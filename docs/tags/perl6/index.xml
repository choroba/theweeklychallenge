      <description>Damian Conway wrote a blog in the last week of May 2019 and confessed that he has been quietly playing at home with &amp;ldquo;Perl Weekly Challenge&amp;rdquo;. With this started the regular blog by him picking weekly challenge and presenting his views.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to loose the track of all his great work, so I decided to put together all his blogs dealing with various challenges in one place. It would be a great read for anyone interested in the detailed analysis.</description>
