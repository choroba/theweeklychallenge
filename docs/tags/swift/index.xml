      <description>HEADLINE The week #075 tasks turned out to be a lot trickier than expected. Generally Task #1 is meant for beginners only but this time it was not the case. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my plan when I proposed the task. I thought couple of for-loops and job done. But when I actually started working on the task, I realised it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as I thought initially. But the good thing is, I got to know about Dynamic Programming (DP).</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Ever since I started doing Swift, I find myself too busy again with my weekly video sessions on top of all.
I need to re-visit my time management chart, may be?
Having said that, I get excited by the doing task in a new language. I wanted to do it in Java to refresh my memory. But couldn&amp;rsquo;t find time for it as I am editing the next week Perl Weekly newsletter also.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE Happy Independence Day to all my fellow Indians This week tasks are once again fun and challenging. Keeping the balance is very difficult, I must admit.
 but I am trying &amp;hellip;
 For the first time, I have joined the private Early Bird Club and taking the advantage of doing the challenge before the launch. I am not sure, if you noticed, this I shared by solutions before lunch time on day one.</description>

      <description>HEADLINE No Linked List related task this week?
I am glad, this week focus was more Array/List related. Technical speaking Array and List aren&amp;rsquo;t the same in Perl. I must admit until I read the article by brian d foy, I thought they were the same. As the famous saying, you learn something new every day.
Both the tasks, this week were not terribly difficult. I noticed many members of Team PWC attempted other languages because they finished the tasks in no time.</description>
