      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.            GitHub meets GitLab  Recently at work, I had to work with a codebase that resides in GitLab.
I am a die-hard GitHub user and never considered GitLab for any one of my pet projects.
All my open-source work is public on GitHub.
That said, I created an account, @manwar, on GitLab as a protest when Microsoft took over GitHub, but I never used it as much as GitHub.</description>
