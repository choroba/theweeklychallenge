      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git show &amp;hellip; I would say, git show, is the most used git command in the life of a programmer after git commit.
Believe it or not, we do so many commits in a day and we peek into a commit if we are investigating an issue.
This is what we do actually: git commit &amp;lt;commit_id&amp;gt;, to be precise.
Yeah, so we all know that, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git bisect &amp;hellip; If you lead life of a programmer, no matter what language you use, you must have used one of the many versioning systems.
CVS was my first introduction to the life saving tool. I think it was early 2000s time period.
I remember a real life incident, I was working as a consultant for a web portal firm.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Promise in Perl  Few days ago, I blogged about Future in Perl where I mentioned Future aka Promise.
In this post, I would replicate the behaviour using CPAN modules: Promise::ES6 and AE.
Since Perl believes in the philosophy of TMTOWTDI, so let&amp;rsquo;s implement the most basic pattern of Promiseas below:
fetch() .then(process) .then(save) .then(display) .catch(error);  #!/usr/bin/env perl use v5.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Scientist in Perl  It was in the year 2017, I found out about the CPAN module Scientist and guess what?
It turned out be created by a very dear friend of mine, Lance Wicks.
I submitted few pull requests, mostly low hanging fruits, during that period and it was kindly accepted and merged.
You might ask me, what is Scientist?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Text Extraction in Perl  I have always been fascinated about image processing but never got my head around it.
Even today, I barely know anything about it.
Text extraction from image is something, I always wanted to try but never managed to do it successfully.
I tried first in Perl but when I failed in my attempt then I tried in Python.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Future in Perl  Recently I have been playing with Concurrent and Parallel Programming in Perl.
It is something that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to do on daily basis.
Having said this exercise, gave me an opportunity to try key features and document for future reference.
In the series, today I am talking about Futures in my favourite programming language Perl.</description>
