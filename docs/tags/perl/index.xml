      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. Recently, I came across a blog post titled, Slice of Perl by Dave Cross.
It&amp;rsquo;s a must-read for Perl programmers, as it highlights a useful feature that can simplify your life.
Reading it, reminded me of a subtle but important distinction I encountered years ago: the difference between List and Array in Perl.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my insights here in the hope that others will find them helpful.</description>

Previously, I covered the other two types of Server-Side Encryption i.e. S3 Encryption and KMS Encryption.
In this type of encryption, customer generates and manages the encryption key.
AWS does not store customer keys, they must be provided with every API request.</description>
