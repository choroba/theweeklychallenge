      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Map::Tube is one of my earliest creations. It was made public on 25th October 2010 to be precise.
I&amp;rsquo;ve given talks on the topic at various Perl conferences and even contributed an article to the Perl Advent Calendar 2024.
There&amp;rsquo;s also a 5-part blog series initiated by Pual Cochrane on the subject. You can check out part one and I highly recommend following the rest of the series as it gets published.</description>

I missed it a lot when I used to program in Java.
Then when Raku introduced its coolest subroutine signatures, I started wondering, when would Perl get subroutine signatures?</description>
