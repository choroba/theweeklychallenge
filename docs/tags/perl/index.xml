      <title>Array vs List</title>
      <link>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/array-vs-list/</link>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. Recently, I came across a blog post titled, Slice of Perl by Dave Cross.
It&amp;rsquo;s a must-read for Perl programmers, as it highlights a useful feature that can simplify your life.
Reading it, reminded me of a subtle but important distinction I encountered years ago: the difference between List and Array in Perl.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my insights here in the hope that others will find them helpful.</description>
