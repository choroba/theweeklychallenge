      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Just a few days ago, I shared an experimental feature added to the Map::Tube, routing framework. It involved adding metadata to stations. You can find out more about it in this post.
In the same spirit, here&amp;rsquo;s one more fature that has been introduced: support for Unicode characters in station names.
To give you some context, when I originally wrote this framework, it was primarily for the London Tube Map.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Map::Tube is one of my earliest creations. It was made public on 25th October 2010 to be precise.
I&amp;rsquo;ve given talks on the topic at various Perl conferences and even contributed an article to the Perl Advent Calendar 2024.
There&amp;rsquo;s also a 5-part blog series initiated by Pual Cochrane on the subject. You can check out part one and I highly recommend following the rest of the series as it gets published.</description>
