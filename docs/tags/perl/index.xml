      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image captured by Salve J. Nilsen.  Journey to the Event  My journey began at 12 PM on Wednesday, April 30th. I took a bus to Heathrow Airport to catch my flight to Berlin via Frankfurt with Lufthansa Airline. The entire journey was a pleasant experience, except for one part: I had to exit the Frankfurt airport and re-enter to catch my connecting flight to Berlin. I had assumed I could simply switch planes without leaving the airport.</description>
