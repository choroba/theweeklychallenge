      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using Leonardo AI.  In the earlier post where I discussed CVE in general and re-created CVE-2018-18311, CVE-2023-31486 and CVE-2023-47038.
Recently I found out about CPAN Security Group which is the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for CPAN and Perl.
At the Perl Toolchain Summit 2025, I had the honour to meet some of the members of the group i.e.  Stig Palmquist and Breno Oliveira.
Continuing with the series, today I am talking about one more CVE-2024-56406.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Title image captured by Salve J. Nilsen.  Journey to the Event  My journey began at 12 PM on Wednesday, April 30th. I took a bus to Heathrow Airport to catch my flight to Berlin via Frankfurt with Lufthansa Airline. The entire journey was a pleasant experience, except for one part: I had to exit the Frankfurt airport and re-enter to catch my connecting flight to Berlin. I had assumed I could simply switch planes without leaving the airport.</description>
