      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Special variable ${^LAST_SUCCESSFUL_PATTERN} in Perl v5.38  I have been following the Perl releases closely for some time now. I don&amp;rsquo;t just track the maintenance releases but also the development releases, which comes more frequently with smaller updates.
It gives me immense pleasure to see how the language has evolved over the last two decades. With so much happening, keeping up with the pace isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.      Read Large File  I remember during my early days, I was asked in one job interview, how would I process a really large text file?.
And I answered, by reading line by line.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t get through the interview, not sure because of my response to the above question.
When I say large file, I mean it.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git show &amp;hellip; I would say, git show, is the most used git command in the life of a programmer after git commit.
Believe it or not, we do so many commits in a day and we peek into a commit if we are investigating an issue.
This is what we do actually: git show &amp;lt;commit_id&amp;gt;, to be precise.
Yeah, so we all know that, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git bisect &amp;hellip; If you lead life of a programmer, no matter what language you use, you must have used one of the many versioning systems.
CVS was my first introduction to the life saving tool. I think it was early 2000s time period.
I remember a real life incident, I was working as a consultant for a web portal firm.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.     Promise in Perl  Few days ago, I blogged about Future in Perl where I mentioned Future aka Promise.
In this post, I would replicate the behaviour using CPAN modules: Promise::ES6 and AE.
Since Perl believes in the philosophy of TMTOWTDI, so let&amp;rsquo;s implement the most basic pattern of Promiseas below:
fetch() .then(process) .then(save) .then(display) .catch(error);  #!</description>
