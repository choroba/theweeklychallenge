      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. 1. Introduction 2. Installation 3. Benchmark 4. Distributed Server Introduction  Recently I shared my experience with Redis/Valkey. Continuing my exploration, today I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about another very popular choice Memcached.
My first introduction to caching was actually through Memcached.
Memcached is a lightning-fast caching server that stores data in RAM for instant access.
At its core. it works like a simple key-value store.</description>
