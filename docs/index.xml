      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Docker Compose  For this post, we will need docker.
Setting Up the Environment  Letâ€™s quickly set up the environment and verify the installation.
$ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  Verify the installation:
$ docker --version Docker version 28.0.1, build 068a01e  Edward J. Sabol, on Facebook reminded me that if I am using recent version of docker then I can use the compose sub-command of the docker also in my examples.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Docker Secret Before we do anything, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure we have the foundation setup properly.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have docker and docker-compose installed, please follow the steps below. Otherwise, proceed to the next section.
$ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin  Add your user to the docker group to avoid the need to use sudo for every docker command:</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Build Docker Image I know the post title is a little vague, what I meant is building docker image for the weekly challenge website.
Introduction  If you are new to The Weekly Challenge then this is the perfect platform for all geeks who want to use their favourite programming language to solve the two challenges we present every week. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert in the programming language, as there is always one simple challenge for beginners and a second, more advanced challenge for those with greater experience.</description>

      <title>Read Large File</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Read Large File I remember during my early days, I was asked in one job interview, how would I process a really large text file?.
And I answered, by reading line by line.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t get through the interview, not sure because of my response to the above question.
When I say large file, I mean it.
How about 1GB in size?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git show &amp;hellip; I would say, git show, is the most used git command in the life of a programmer after git commit.
Believe it or not, we do so many commits in a day and we peek into a commit if we are investigating an issue.
This is what we do actually: git show &amp;lt;commit_id&amp;gt;, to be precise.
Yeah, so we all know that, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of this post?</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  git bisect &amp;hellip; If you lead life of a programmer, no matter what language you use, you must have used one of the many versioning systems.
CVS was my first introduction to the life saving tool. I think it was early 2000s time period.
I remember a real life incident, I was working as a consultant for a web portal firm.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using FREE version of ChatGPT.  Promise in Perl  Few days ago, I blogged about Future in Perl where I mentioned Future aka Promise.
In this post, I would replicate the behaviour using CPAN modules: Promise::ES6 and AE.
Since Perl believes in the philosophy of TMTOWTDI, so let&amp;rsquo;s implement the most basic pattern of Promiseas below:
fetch() .then(process) .then(save) .then(display) .catch(error);  #!/usr/bin/env perl use v5.</description>
