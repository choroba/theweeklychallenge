      <guid>https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/cve-2024-56406/</guid>
      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using Leonardo AI.  In the earlier post where I discussed CVE in general and re-created CVE-2018-18311, CVE-2023-31486 and CVE-2023-47038.
Recently I found out about CPAN Security Group which is the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for CPAN and Perl.
At the Perl Toolchain Summit 2025, I had the honour to meet some of the members of the group i.e.  Stig Palmquist and Breno Oliveira.
Continuing with the series, today I am talking about one more CVE-2024-56406.</description>
