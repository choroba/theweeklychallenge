      <description>Raku Solutions Weekly Review  Note from the Reviewer This week&amp;rsquo;s review has been generated by ChatGPT, an AI language model. The AI has analyzed the submitted solutions for both tasks and grouped them based on the methods and features used. It also includes the AI&#39;s own solutions for each task. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and clarity of the review, please feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.</description>
