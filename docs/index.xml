      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. In February 2025, with the release of Perl v5.41.9, a method inside the new experimental class feature can be declared as a lexical method.
Before diving into the details, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back.

      <title>Array vs List</title>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: Image is generated using ChatGPT. Recently, I came across a blog post titled, Slice of Perl by Dave Cross.
It&amp;rsquo;s a must-read for Perl programmers, as it highlights a useful feature that can simplify your life.
Reading it, reminded me of a subtle but important distinction I encountered years ago: the difference between List and Array in Perl.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my insights here in the hope that others will find them helpful.</description>
