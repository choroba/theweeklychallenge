      <description>Raku Solutions Weekly Review  Pre-thoughts The first task was to find the magic number that, when added to every item of the first array, converts the array in such a way that all the numbers that you get after the addition are found in the second array of the same length. Sounds messy, but it effectively means that if you sort both arrays, then the difference between their corresponding elements is constant.</description>
