      <description>Raku Solutions Weekly Review  Task 1 In the first task, you have an array of integers @ints and a target number $k. You need to print the indices of those elements, which are equal to the target, but you need to search in the sorted source data.

say max($neg, $pos); where $neg and $pos are the numbers of negative and positive data items in the original array.</description>
