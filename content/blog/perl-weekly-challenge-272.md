## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #272` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome new member `ATSchneider`, an experienced `Perl` hacker. Thank you for sharing solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-271/atschneid/perl) and [**Haskell**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-271/atschneid/haskell) in the very first week.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank `Nelo Tovar` for getting back to me with regard to the prize money. Happy to share that the payment gone without any trouble as confirmed by `Nelo`.

I am still waiting to hear from the remaining two champions, `Mustafa Aydin` and `Asher Harvey-Smith`. I would request you to get back to me at `perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com` ASAP.

Today is the first `Monday` and time to declare our next champion. With great pride, I would like to announce `Laurent Rosenfeld` as the second time champion. Those who are new to `Team PWC`, he was the first champion declared in the `Week #13` (**Jun 23, 2019**).

Happy to see the pick up in contributions after a little dip in the past two weeks. Please keep the momentum going up.

## Task 1: Defang IP Address {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a valid `IPv4` address.

Write a script to return the defanged version of the given IP address.

>    A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

#### Example 1

    Input: $ip = "1.1.1.1"
    Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"

#### Example 2

    Input: $ip = "255.101.1.0"
    Output: "255[.]101[.]1[.]0"

<br>

## Task 2: String Score {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string, `$str`.

Write a script to return the score of the given string.

>    The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = "hello"
    Output: 13

    ASCII values of characters:
    h = 104
    e = 101
    l = 108
    l = 108
    o = 111

    Score => |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111|
          => 3 + 7 + 0 + 3
          => 13

#### Example 2

    Input: "perl"
    Output: 30

    ASCII values of characters:
    p = 112
    e = 101
    r = 114
    l = 108

    Score => |112 - 101| + |101 - 114| + |114 - 108|
          => 11 + 13 + 6
          => 30

#### Example 3

    Input: "raku"
    Output: 37

    ASCII values of characters:
    r = 114
    a = 97
    k = 107
    u = 117

    Score => |114 - 97| + |97 - 107| + |107 - 117|
          => 17 + 10 + 10
          => 37
