# Get to know about PokGoPun.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Robert Ransbottom`, the winner of **[May 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-05)**.

Today we are talking to `PokGoPun`, the winner of **June 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**PokGoPun:** My passion in computer programming started since childhood when my parents brought home `8-bit` home computer that equipped with `Microsoft Extended BASIC`, I recalled hooking the computer to TV, writing and running `BASIC` programs and then saving them to cassette tape for later modification, what a fun!

During my years in high school, my computer skill was still very much limited to `BASIC` programming as `Apple Macintosh` and `x86 PC` were not affordable so I diverted my attention to math and consider going for a degree in math science. However, I went for a degree in electrical engineering instead after finishing high school for a reason of job security.

After getting a degree in electrical engineering and work in the field for a while, I was able to buy my first `x86 PC` and learned what I had been missing before switching to work in `IT` field.

My early IT careers started with local companies as technical support doing networking and application installations on various platforms (around the time `Windows/Linux` still trying to catch up with `Netware/SCO Unix`) before moving to work for multinational companies in a role of system administrator/engineer which giving me opportunities to do more programming for system integration and task automation.

After that, I joined a company that provides global financial market data and infrastructure as a solution consultant for its flagship datafeed products before moving to a role in its network management team managing its global network infrastructure.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using Perl?

**PokGoPun:** I started using `Perl` in `2013` while working in network management team to develop solutions to integrate network management systems with machine data analytic platform which in turn being used to develop and drive automations for network management services. `Perl/CPAN` always provide me solutions to these challenges.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**PokGoPun:** I have followed `Perl6/Raku` Weekly News and seen the link to `The Weekly Challenge` for sometime but I've just decided to give it a try early this year.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**PokGoPun:**  For me, this is a great place to getting out of my comfort zone and learn more about computer programming thanks to lots of contribution from many competitive coders in different languages and styles. `Colin's Perl review` is epic, I am alway amazed with the depth of his knowledge and feel flattered everytime my code get reviewed by him.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**PokGoPun:** Around couple hours but can be more if the challenge tasks require me to do more research on the topic that I am not familiar with.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**PokGoPun:** I try my best to develop and complete my own solutions first before checking others. My favorites are `Abigail` (while he was still contributing), `E. Choroba` and `James Smith`.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**PokGoPun:** Try to complete your own solution first and then checkout other's solutions and you may be amazed how things can be done differently, pick up bits and pieces that work for you along the way.

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**PokGoPun:** Many thanks for developing, maintaining `The Weekly Challenge` which inspires me to keep learning more about computer programming.
