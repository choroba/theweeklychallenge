## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #337` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to announce the next `Champion of the Month`.

With great pleasure, I declare `Simon Proctor` as the next champion. As of today, he has contributed `285 Raku`, `5 Perl` and `17 blogs`. He is currently ranked `#38` in the leaderboard. Congratulation `Simon`.

The school holiday is over now, back to busy schedule. I am sure, parents with school going kids would relate with me. It is a tough job.

I hope you find the weekly challenge entertaining and engaging.

<br>

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Smaller Than Current {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of numbers, `@num1`.

Write a script to return an array, `@num2`, where `$num2[i]` is the count of all numbers less than or equal to `$num1[i]`.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @num1 = (6, 5, 4, 8)
    Output: (2, 1, 0, 3)

    index 0: numbers <= 6 are 5, 4    => 2
    index 1: numbers <= 5 are 4       => 1
    index 2: numbers <= 4, none       => 0
    index 3: numbers <= 8 are 6, 5, 4 => 3

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @num1 = (7, 7, 7, 7)
    Output: (3, 3, 3, 3)

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @num1 = (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
    Output: (4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @num1 = (-1, 0, 3, -2, 1)
    Output: (1, 2, 4, 0, 3)

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @num1 = (0, 1, 1, 2, 0)
    Output: (1, 3, 3, 4, 1)

<br>

## Task 2: Odd Matrix {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given `row` and `col`, also a list of positions in the matrix.

Write a script to perform action on each location (0-indexed) as provided in the list and find out the total odd valued cells.

For each location (r, c), do both of the following:

    a) Increment by 1 all the cells on row r.
    b) Increment by 1 all the cells on column c.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $row = 2, $col = 3, @locations = ([0,1],[1,1])
    Output: 6

    Initial:
    [ 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]

    Apply [0,1]:
    Increment row 0:
    Before     After
    [ 0 0 0 ]  [ 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]  [ 0 0 0 ]
    Increment col 1:
    Before     After
    [ 1 1 1 ]  [ 1 2 1 ]
    [ 0 0 0 ]  [ 0 1 0 ]

    Apply [1,1]:
    Increment row 1:
    Before     After
    [ 1 2 1 ]  [ 1 2 1 ]
    [ 0 1 0 ]  [ 1 2 1 ]
    Increment col 1:
    Before     After
    [ 1 2 1 ]  [ 1 3 1 ]
    [ 1 2 1 ]  [ 1 3 1 ]

    Final:
    [ 1 3 1 ]
    [ 1 3 1 ]

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $row = 2, $col = 2, @locations = ([1,1],[0,0])
    Output: 0

    Initial:
    [ 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 ]

    Apply [1,1]:
    Increment row 1:
    Before    After
    [ 0 0 ]   [ 0 0 ]

    Increment col 1:
    Before    After
