## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #266` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Normally we focus on varieties of solutions in different languages every week but never talked about blog post we received every week. We have handful of regulars who blog every week without fail. It would be unfair if I name one but you know who I am talking about. I would like to take this opportunity and thank each bloggers for their dedication. I know it is time consuming to write engaging blog post. Infact, it takes more time to blog than code, in my personal experience. It is the blog post that shares the background story behind each solution. It is not easy to extract that information by reading the code. Looking at the last `5 weeks` stats, we are getting `25 or more` blog post every week. First thing that catches my attention is the title of the post. If you take a closer look of weekly contributions, you will find some very creative title.

Keep it up great work and share the knowledge with the team.

## Task 1: Uncommon Words {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two sentences, `$line1` and `$line2`.

Write a script to find all uncommmon words in any order in the given two sentences. Return `('')` if none found.

> A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences and doesn't appear in other sentence.

#### Example 1

    Input: $line1 = 'Mango is sweet'
           $line2 = 'Mango is sour'
    Output: ('sweet', 'sour')

#### Example 2

    Input: $line1 = 'Mango Mango'
           $line2 = 'Orange'
    Output: ('Orange')

#### Example 3

    Input: $line1 = 'Mango is Mango'
           $line2 = 'Orange is Orange'
    Output: ('')

<br>

## Task 2: X Matrix {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a square matrix, `$matrix`.

Write a script to find if the given matrix is `X Matrix`.

> A square matrix is an X Matrix if all the elements on the main diagonal and antidiagonal are non-zero and everything else are zero.

#### Example 1

    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 0, 2],
                       [0, 3, 4, 0],
                       [0, 5, 6, 0],
                       [7, 0, 0, 1],
                     ]
    Output: true

#### Example 2

    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 2, 3],
                       [4, 5, 6],
                       [7, 8, 9],
                     ]
    Output: false

#### Example 3

    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 2],
                       [0, 3, 0],
                       [4, 0, 5],
                     ]
    Output: true
