## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #307` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the first champion of the year `2025`. With great pleasure, I declare `Andreas Mahnke`. as `Champion of the Month: January`. He is relatively new to the team but very consistent. I request `Andreas` to get back to us with the `PayPal` account so that we can send the prize money asap.

I would also to take this opportunity to request two past winners, `Laurent Rosenfeld` and `E. Choroba` to share `PayPal` account. Your winning amount is still with us. Just in case, you can reach out to me at `perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com`.

Welcome back, `Marton Polgar` and thanks for sharing solutions in [**Prolog**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-306/2colours/prolog).

Welcome back, `Simon Green` and thanks for sharing solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-306/sgreen/perl) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-306/sgreen/python) alongwith bonus [**blog post**](https://dev.to/simongreennet/the-last-odd-kib).

## Task 1: Check Order {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to re-arrange the given array in an increasing order and return the indices where it differs from the original array.


#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (5, 2, 4, 3, 1)
    Output: (0, 2, 3, 4)

    Before: (5, 2, 4, 3, 1)
    After : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    Difference at indices: (0, 2, 3, 4)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 1, 1, 3)
    Output: (1, 3)

    Before: (1, 2, 1, 1, 3)
    After : (1, 1, 1, 2, 3)

    Difference at indices: (1, 3)

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (3, 1, 3, 2, 3)
    Output: (0, 1, 3)

    Before: (3, 1, 3, 2, 3)
    After : (1, 2, 3, 3, 3)

    Difference at indices: (0, 1, 3)

<br>

## Task 2: Find Anagrams {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of words, `@words`.

Write a script to find any two consecutive words and if they are anagrams, drop the first word and keep the second. You continue this until there is no more anagrams in the given list and return the count of final list.

#### Example 1

    Input: @words = ("acca", "dog", "god", "perl", "repl")
    Output: 3

    Step 1: "dog" and "god" are anagrams, so dropping "dog" and keeping "god" => ("acca", "god", "perl", "repl")
    Step 2: "perl" and "repl" are anagrams, so dropping "perl" and keeping "repl" => ("acca", "god", "repl")

#### Example 2

    Input: @words = ("abba", "baba", "aabb", "ab", "ab")
    Output: 2

    Step 1: "abba" and "baba" are anagrams, so dropping "abba" and keeping "baba" => ("baba", "aabb", "ab", "ab")
    Step 2: "baba" and "aabb" are anagrams, so dropping "baba" and keeping "aabb" => ("aabb", "ab", "ab")
    Step 3: "ab" and "ab" are anagrams, so dropping "ab" and keeping "ab" => ("aabb", "ab")
