# Get to know about Robbie Hatley

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `BarrOff`, the winner of [**August 2023**](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-08).

Today we are talking to `Robbie Hatley`, the winner of **September 2023** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Robbie:** I'm a `Computer Programmer` and `Electronics Engineer`, among other things. I started programming as a college student in `1973` on the twin `IBM-370 Computers` at `Orange Coast College (Costa Mesa, California)`, using `APL`, `Fortran`, `JCL`, and `BASIC`. I transitioned to `C` and `C++` when I got my first actual paid programming job in `2002`.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Robbie:** At work I've mostly been doing embedded programming (`2002 to present`), so I mostly use `C` and `C++`. And I used to use those languages at home for data-management programming (finding files, bulk file renaming, removing duplicate files, cloning directory structures, etc). But `C` and `C++` suck at those tasks. So I starting writing such programs in `AWK` instead. But then an engineer friend of mine told me `"You should write that in Perl instead!"`. So I started learning `Perl` in `2005`, and in `2015` I transitioned all programs related to text, files, and directories to `Perl`, primarily due to its excellent support for `Unicode` and `regular expressions`.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robbie:** After I started making heavy use of `Perl` in `2015`, I looked for `Perl` groups on `Facebook` and found the `"Perl Programmers"` group. On joining that, I was exposed to `The Weekly Challenge`. I submitted my first entry in `January 2021 (#97)`, and I've become a regular participant starting in `September 2022 (#183 and onward)`.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robbie:** It's a chance to practice `Perl` programming regularly, with challenges ranging from easy to hard.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robbie:** I've spent anything from `30 minutes` to `8 hours`, but typically I'll spend `30 mins` on `ch-1` and `60 mins` on `ch-2`. That includes writing and debugging the scripts, pushing to my own Github repository, writing a blog post, pushing to the main PWCC repo, and sending pull requests.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Robbie:** I don't check-out others solutions as much as I should, because of time constraints, but I do from time to time. One PWCC member I've recently enjoyed reading is `Matthew Neleigh`: well-organized and well-commented code; no guessing `"what does THIS do?"`, because it's clear what each piece of code is doing.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robbie:** Learning `Github` and `git` is going to be your biggest hurdle, so dive right in and learn and practice git as much as you can. Tip: install the "micro" text editor then set git to use THAT for commit messages instead of vi (its default); that will make things much easier.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Robbie:** Two words of advice to all `Perl programmers: Be grateful`. Imagine if `Larry Wall` had never invented `Perl`? And you had to rewrite all your `Perl` code in `C`? The horror! One-liners become `5 pages of code`! Ewww. So be grateful that we have this concise, flexible language and don't take it for granted.

That brings the end of the conversation with **Robbie Hatley**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
