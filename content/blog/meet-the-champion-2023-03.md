# Get to know about David Ferrone

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Solathian`, the winner of **[February 2023](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-02)**.

Today we are talking to `David Ferrone`, the winner of **March 2023** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**David:** We had a `PC` in the house around `1992`, I was eight and it ended up in my bedroom. I sometimes wrote journal entries in `DOS`, and created a few batch files. My father used `The Print Shop` and `Corel Draw` for his work as a graphic artist, so I was familiar with plenty of cool software. I liked this game `Mad Maze` but it was a long-distance call for us to use `Prodigy` so we couldn't afford to play it often.

In high school I was editing `autoexec.bat` to annoy my friends. I learned a bit of `QBasic`, `Pascal`, `C`, and `C++` during high school, as well as `HTML/CSS` and `Javascript` at home to make a few websites. (Thank you `Angelfire` and `GeoCities`!)
I started college in `2001` and abandoned `Computer Science` for `Pure Mathematics` - except for a tiny bit of `Linux` and `Perl`. I played nethack on `alt.org`, hung out on `slashdot.org` and `anandtech.com`, learning about computers as a hobby between classes at the library.

I had minored in `Statistics` as well, and was familiar with `SAS` and `R`. I started really using `Linux` (i.e. not dual booting) around `2009`. I was a few years into graduate school and it just seemed more useful to have a handful of programming languages pre-installed. Not long after that I was using `Matlab` and `Python` to generate some pretty graphs or to verify some conditions related to wavelet coefficients.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**David:** The book `Learning Perl` was on sale around `2002`, and I fell in love. Having tinkered with `C`, `C++`, and `Linux`, `Perl` always felt natural and fun. I've used `Perl` for a bunch of projects, basic scripting, sys admin stuff, web scraping tasks, streaming, and websites. It's hard to overstate how useful it's been as a hobbyist.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**David:** I stumbled across the weekly challenges on github this past `December`, while I was working on `Project Euler` and `Advent of Code`.

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**David:** I love puzzles, these are typically a bit challenging but not too much. And you can challenge yourself to write the shortest script, or make it obfuscated, or practice good coding habits.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**David:** I try to spend a few hours early in the week. Once in a while they are harder, or I misread something and it takes a few days.

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**David:** A lot of the blogs are very well done, even inspirational - I check them out afterward, if I have time.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest to someone who just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**David:** Have fun!

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**David:** Thanks for providing such a huge collection of exercises!

That brings the end of the conversation with **David Ferrone**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
