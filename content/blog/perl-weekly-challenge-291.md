## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #291` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Ryan Thompson`, for back to back contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-290/ryan-thompson/perl) and [**blog post**](https://ry.ca/2024/10/pwc-290-seeing-double-twice).

We received `72` guest contributions back to back. Thank you everyone. As of today, we received `2705` contributions in the year `2024` beating last year contributions `2629`. The best year for guest contributions was `2022` when we received `2994`. I hope we can beat that too.

As for regular contributions, last year `2023` was the best performance year when we received `5702` contributions. As of today, we have received `4501` contributions. There is every possibility we can beat that number this year.

Let's keep the momentum up and share knowledge every week.

## Task 1: Middle Index {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the leftmost middle index (MI) i.e. the smallest amongst all the possible ones.

> A middle index is an index where ints[0] + ints[1] + ... + ints[MI-1] == ints[MI+1] + ints[MI+2] + ... + ints[ints.length-1].

    If MI == 0, the left side sum is considered to be 0. Similarly,
    if MI == ints.length - 1, the right side sum is considered to be 0.

Return the leftmost MI that satisfies the condition, or -1 if there is no such index.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (2, 3, -1, 8, 4)
    Output: 3

    The sum of the numbers before index 3 is: 2 + 3 + -1 = 4
    The sum of the numbers after index 3 is: 4 = 4

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, -1, 4)
    Output: 2

    The sum of the numbers before index 2 is: 1 + -1 = 0
    The sum of the numbers after index 2 is: 0

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 5)
    Output: -1

    There is no valid MI.

<br>

## Task 2: Poker Hand Rankings {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Robbie Hatley](https://hatley-software.blogspot.com/)
***

A draw poker hand consists of 5 cards, drawn from a pack of 52: no jokers, no wild cards. An ace can rank either high or low.

Write a script to determine the following three things:

    1. How many different 5-card hands can be dealt?
    2. How many different hands of each of the 10 ranks can be dealt?
       See here for descriptions of the 10 ranks of Poker hands:
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands#Hand-ranking_categories
    3. Check the ten numbers you get in step 2 by adding them together
       and showing that they're equal to the number you get in step 1.
