## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #316` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and it's time to declare the next champion!

With great pride, I announce, `Eric Cheung`, as the `Champion of the Month` for `March 2025`. He was last declared champion in `March 2022`, exactly three years ago. `Eric` has been a guest contributor since day one. His favourite languages are `Excel VBA` and `Python`. As of today, he shared `63` solutions in `Excel VBA` and `325` solutions in `Python`. Currently he is ranked `#12` on the `Guest Leaders` list with a total score of `388`.

`Eric`, please share your `PayPal` details so that the prize money can be transferred easily.

I've noticed a dip in contributions in `Perl` and `Raku` but at the same time, there has been growth in others programming languages. If you look at the trend closely, you'll notice we have a strong and dedicated groups of supporters who regularly share solutions.

One such contributor I'd like to highlight is `BarrOff`. As of today, he has shared `47` solutions in `Perl` and `157` solutions in `Raku`. For a while, he is only submitting solution to `Task #1` in `Raku`. The reason, I'm mentioning him is because despite clearly being busy, he still makes the effort to find time for at least one task each week. That level of dedication deserves a big round of applause.

Interestingly, the timing of his contributions, usually late on `Sunday` evenings,  makes me believe that he's a busy techie juggling many things. Every time, I aceept and merge his submission, it brings a sense of joy and appreciation.

I would also like to thank, `Kjetil Skotheim`, for sharing solutions to the past challenges.

**Do we have any frontend experts in the team?**

**Why am I asking?**

Well, I am not sure if you've noticed, but the top menu bar on the weekly challenge website doesn't work properly on mobile devices. I finally managed to implement a quick and dirty fix so I can at least navigate the site on my phone. However, it's still far from perfect.

If you know what's missing or have ideas for a better fix, please do share your expertise!

By the way, I've made few improvements to the `Charts` page. Please let me know what do you think. Any better?

Last but not least, thank you to the entire team for your continuous support and encouragement. Your dedication keeps this challenge going strong!
