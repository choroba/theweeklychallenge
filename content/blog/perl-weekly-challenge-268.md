## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #268` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome, `Princy Mangla` from `India` to `Team PWC`. She was one of the applicants of `Outreachy Program`. She first shared solutions to `Week #263` in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-263/princy-perl/perl). And then she surprised us with another solutions to `Week #267` in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-267/princy-perl/perl).

Welcome back `Marton Polgar` after the break. He mostly contributed solutions in `Raku`. In the past he shared solutions in `Prolog` as well but last week he shared solutions to [**Week #266**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-266/2colours/php) and [**Week #267**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-267/2colours/php) in `PHP` too.

We have another surprise by `Lance Wicks` as he shared solutions in [**Roc**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-267/lance-wicks/roc/main.roc) and [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-267/lance-wicks/perl).

I have a good news that I want to share with `Team PWC`. Last week, `Lance` contacted me with the offer to sponsor the monthly champion prize money. As you all know, I did try once to attract the sponsor at the end of last year when `Pete` stopped the sponsorship. Unfortunately it didn't work out. Because of this, first three winners of the year `2024` didn't get any prize money. `Lance` has agreed to sponsor the next `12 months` to begin with. I requested him if we can offer the prize money to the past three winners and he accepted my request. So in the next couple of days, I would contact the winners of `Jan`, `Feb` and `Mar` with regard to the prize money. Just for record, the prize money stays the same `US $50`. Winner would get the choice of direct cash transfer (if possible) or voucher of their choice (not limited to just `Amazon Voucher`).

Also today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare another champion of the month. I am happy to announce `Reinier Maliepaard` as our next champion. As of today he shared `13 solutions` in `Perl` and `7 blog posts`. He is an experienced `Perl` hacker from `Netherlands` who joined the `Team PWC` recently.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank `Lance Wicks` for the support. I am relieved as this has sorted the year `2024` for now. As you all know, we started with weekly winner and then shifted to monthly winner. I am hoping one day we would have enough sponsors to go back to weekly winner.

I am grateful to each and every member of `Team PWC` for their contributions. Thanks to their support and encouragement, we are still going steadily. Let us all keep sharing knowledge and spread the word.

## Task 1: Magic Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two arrays of integers of same size, `@x` and `@y`.

Write a script to find the magic number that when added to each elements of one of the array gives the second array. Elements order is not important.

#### Example 1

    Input: @x = (3, 7, 5)
           @y = (9, 5, 7)
    Output: 2

    The magic number is 2.
    @x = (3, 7, 5)
       +  2  2  2
    @y = (5, 9, 7)

#### Example 2

    Input: @x = (1, 2, 1)
           @y = (5, 4, 4)
    Output: 3

    The magic number is 3.
    @x = (1, 2, 1)
       +  3  3  3
    @y = (5, 4, 4)

#### Example 3

    Input: @x = (2)
           @y = (5)
    Output: 3

<br>

## Task 2: Number Game {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`, with even number of elements.

Write a script to create a new array made up of elements of the given array. Pick the two smallest integers and add it to new array in decreasing order i.e. high to low. Keep doing until the given array is empty.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (2, 5, 3, 4)
    Output: (3, 2, 5, 4)

    Round 1: we picked (2, 3) and push it to the new array (3, 2)
    Round 2: we picked the remaining (4, 5) and push it to the new array (5, 4)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 4, 6, 1)
    Output: (1, 1, 4, 3, 6, 4, 9, 6)

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 2, 3)
    Output: (2, 1, 3, 2)
