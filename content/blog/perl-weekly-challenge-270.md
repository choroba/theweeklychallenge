## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #270` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Andrew Shitov`, for yet another `Raku` review for [**Week #268**](/blog/p6-review-challenge-268).

Did you notice, in recent time, we are exploring guest languages more than the primary languages `Perl` and `Raku`?

It was a close contest last week. We had `78` guest contributions as compare to `74` regular contributions, if we take blogs out of the race.

Let us all celebrate the top `Guest Contributors` as listed below:

    1) Ali Moradi: Go, Java, Modula 3, Ruby, Standard ML
    2) Asher Harvey-Smith: APL, BQN, Haskell, Hy, J, Nu
    3) David Ferrone: C, JavaScript, Python, Rust
    4) Eric Cheung: Python
    5) Lubos Kolouch: Python
    6) Luca Ferrari: Java, PostgreSQL, Python
    7) Nelo Tovar: Bash
    8) Packy Anderson: Elixir, Python
    9) PokGoPun: Go, Python
    10) Roger Bell_West: Crystal, JavaScript, Kotlin, Lua, PostScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala
    11) Simon Green: Python
    12) Steven Wilson: Python
    13) Ulrich Rieke: C++, Haskell, Rust

I have reached out to the recent champions with regard to the prize money. I sent email to `Nelo Tovar`, `Mustafa Aydin`, `Asher Harvey-Smith` and `Reinier Maliepaard` on `14th May 2024`. So far I received reply back from `Reinier Maliepaard` only. Thank you `Reinier` for getting back to me and successfully transferred the prize money. I would like to mention, `PayPal` is also an option for payment if you prefer. I would request please check out `Spam` in case it went straight there. Looking forward to your reply. Just in case, you can even reach out to me on `perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com`.

## Task 1: Special Positions {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix.

Write a script to return the number of special positions in the given binary matrix.

> A position (i, j) is called special if $matrix[i][j] == 1 and all other elements in the row i and column j are 0.

#### Example 1

    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 1],
                       [1, 0, 0],
                     ]
    Output: 1

    There is only one special position (1, 2) as $matrix[1][2] == 1
    and all other elements in row 1 and column 2 are 0.

#### Example 2

    Input: $matrix = [ [1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 1, 0],
                       [0, 0, 1],
                     ]
    Output: 3

    Special positions are (0,0), (1, 1) and (2,2).

<br>

## Task 2: Distribute Elements {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are give an array of integers, `@ints` and two integers, `$x` and `$y`.

Write a script to execute one of the two options:

    Level 1:
    Pick an index i of the given array and do $ints[i] += 1

    Level 2:
    Pick two different indices i,j and do $ints[i] +=1 and $ints[j] += 1.

You are allowed to perform as many levels as you want to make every elements in the given array equal. There is cost attach for each level, for Level 1, the cost is `$x` and `$y` for Level 2.

In the end return the minimum cost to get the work done.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (4, 1), $x = 3 and $y = 2
    Output: 9

    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 2)

    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 3)

    Level 1: i=1, so $ints[1] += 1.
    @ints = (4, 4)

    We perforned operation Level 1, 3 times.
    So the total cost would be 3 x $x => 3 x 3 => 9

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 3, 3, 3, 5), $x = 2 and $y = 1
    Output: 6

    Level 2: i=0, j=1, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[1] += 1
    @ints = (3, 4, 3, 3, 5)

    Level 2: i=0, j=2, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[2] += 1
    @ints = (4, 4, 4, 3, 5)

    Level 2: i=0, j=3, so $ints[0] += 1 and $ints[3] += 1
    @ints = (5, 4, 4, 4, 5)

    Level 2: i=1, j=2, so $ints[1] += 1 and $ints[2] += 1
    @ints = (5, 5, 5, 4, 5)

    Level 1: i=3, so $ints[3] += 1
    @ints = (5, 5, 5, 5, 5)

    We perforned operation Level 1, 1 time and Level 2, 4 times.
    So the total cost would be (1 x $x) + (4 x $y) => (1 x 2) + (4 x 1) => 6
