## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #327` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Finally the wait is over, we have back to back weeks reaching the magical number of `100+` contributions.

`Week #325` became the first week of the year `2025` to reach the target with some late contributions.

`Week #326` immediately became the most popular week of the year `2025` beating the `Week #325`.

With regard to the guest contributions, `Week #326`, is the best week of the year `2025`.

Well done, `Team PWC`, for your support and encouragements.

Last week, we received surprise contributions by one of the earliest member, `Simon Proctor`.

Welcome back, `Simon` and thanks for your contributions in [**Raku**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-326/simon-proctor/raku) and [**blog post**](https://khanate.co.uk/weekly/326.html). I hope you are doing great. We all missed you.

Welcome back, `mauke`, another very old member of `Team PWC`.  Thanks for the contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-326/mauke/perl).

I would like to thank, `BarOff`, for last minute contributions to `Week #325`. It helped us reach the magical figure.

I noticed some members sharing solutions on various social platform. I loved it. It feels great to see member sharing views on each others code.

Last but not least, thank you to all who keep sending kind words every week. Although I don't get to reply each, please do remember, your words are priceless.

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Missing Integers {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of `n` integers.

Write a script to find all the missing integers in the range `1..n` in the given array.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5)
    Output: (4, 6)

    The given array has 6 elements.
    So we are looking for integers in the range 1..6 in the given array.
    The missing integers: (4, 6)

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 1, 1)
    Output: (2, 3)

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 2, 1)
    Output: (3)

<br>

## Task 2: MAD {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of distinct integers.

Write a script to find all pairs of elements with minimum absolute difference (MAD) of any two elements.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (4, 1, 2, 3)
    Output: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]

    The minimum absolute difference is 1.
    Pairs with MAD: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 3, 7, 11, 15)
    Output: [1,3]

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 5, 3, 8)
    Output: [1,3], [3,5]
