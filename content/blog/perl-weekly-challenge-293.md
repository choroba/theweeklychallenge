## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #293` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

It was a bit rough week for me as I am trying to get back to my usual routine. Also I was a bit busy with `London Perl Workshop 2024`. I was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow team member, `Arne Sommer`, after a long time. Last time we met was at conference in `Riga` many years ago. I noticed another name, `Santiago Leyva` in the list but didn't get to say hi unfortunately. If anyone interested in my talk then you can grab the [**slides as pdf**](https://manwar.org/talks/LPW-2024.pdf).

Please keep sharing the knowledge every week and don't forget to have fun too.

## Task 1: Similar Dominos {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of dominos, `@dominos`.

Write a script to return the number of dominoes that are similar to any other domino.

> $dominos[i] = [a, b] and $dominos[j] = [c, d] are same if either (a = c and b = d) or (a = d and b = c).

#### Example 1

    Input: @dominos = ([1, 3], [3, 1], [2, 4], [6, 8])
    Output: 2

    Similar Dominos: $dominos[0], $dominos[1]

#### Example 2

    Input: @dominos = ([1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2])
    Output: 3

    Similar Dominos: $dominos[0], $dominos[1], $dominos[3]

## Task 2: Boomerang {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of points, `(x, y)`.

Write a script to find out if the given points are a boomerang.

> A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

#### Example 1

    Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 3], [3,2] )
    Output: true

#### Example 2

    Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3] )
    Output: false

#### Example 3

    Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3] )
    Output: true

#### Example 4

    Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3] )
    Output: false

#### Example 5

    Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1] )
    Output: false

#### Example 6

    Input: @points = ( [0, 0], [2, 3], [4, 5] )
    Output: true
