## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #331` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let's all welcome two new members to `Team PWC:` `Harry Wozniak` and `Fabio Valeri` to `Team PWC`. Both are experienced `Perl` hacker.

Do you remember our fellow team member, `Humberto Massa`?

Well, I recently discovered his `Raku` magics on social media. Another member who shares such insights is `James Smith`.

I noticed `Humberto` also posted something like:

<br>

    @manwar again, from the endoscopy clinic wait room, ... `.

<br>

To be honest, this is worrisome. I hope and pray he's ok.

I've copied his one-liners and saved them in the repository, so others can benefit from them as well.

A few years ago, I had to undergo an endoscopy myself. It was one of the scariest moments of my life.

Here in `England`, the school summer break starts this week. This time, my three school going angels won't let me stay at home.

So I had to make a last minute booking for a short trip.

Travel Itenary:

    - Departing: Saturday  26th July, 2025
    - Returning: Wednesday 30th July, 2025

This will slightly disrupt the weekly challenge schedule.

So here's the plan:


    - I'll release the new challenge, Week #332, on Friday night or Saturday morning before leaving.
    - This gives you all a couple of extra days to work on it.

There's another small issue, I won't be able to process all contributions for `Week #331` immediately.

`Why?` Because some members submit their work on `Sunday`, so I'll handle those when I return on `Wednesday`.

Additionally, my weekly contributions review for the `Perl Weekly` newsletter, will be partial this time.

Amid all this, I almost forgot to mention that we've once again  received `100+` contributions once again, the third time in the year `2025` so far.

Well done `Team PWC`, let's keep the momentum going strong.

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Last Word {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string.

Write a script to find the length of last word in the given string.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = "The Weekly Challenge"
    Output: 9

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = "   Hello   World    "
    Output: 5

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: $str = "Let's begin the fun"
    Output: 3

<br>

## Task 2: Buddy Strings {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings, `source` and `target`.

Write a script to find out if the given strings are `Buddy Strings`.

    If swapping of a letter in one string make them same as the other then they are `Buddy Strings`.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $source = "fuck"
           $target = "fcuk"
    Output: true

    The swapping of 'u' with 'c' makes it buddy strings.

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $source = "love"
           $target = "love"
    Output: false

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: $source = "fodo"
           $target = "food"
    Output: true

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: $source = "feed"
           $target = "feed"
    Output: true
