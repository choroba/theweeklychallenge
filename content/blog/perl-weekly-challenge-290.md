## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #290` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare our next champion. With great pride, I announce `Roger Bell_West` as our next champion. Thank you, `Roger` for your support and encouragements. I will be in touch with you in the next few days with regard to the prize money.

It has been very busy week for me personally as you must have noticed in delay of processing your contributions. Start of `October` always bring negativity around me. In the past also, it stays most of the time way past end of `March`. I thought I was fully prepared this time unlike last 2 years but ...

I hope you are having fun with `Hacktoberfest`.  Keep contributing to the weekly challenge or any other open source codebase of your choice.

## Task 1: Double Exist {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find if there exist two indices `$i` and `$j` such that:

    1) $i != $j
    2) 0 <= ($i, $j) < scalar @ints
    3) $ints[$i] == 2 * $ints[$j]

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (6, 2, 3, 3)
    Output: true

    For $i = 0, $j = 2
    $ints[$i] = 6 => 2 * 3 =>  2 * $ints[$j]

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (3, 1, 4, 13)
    Output: false

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (2, 1, 4, 2)
    Output: true

    For $i = 2, $j = 3
    $ints[$i] = 4 => 2 * 2 =>  2 * $ints[$j]

<br>

## Task 2: Luhn's Algorithm {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Andrezgz](https://github.com/andrezgz)
***

You are given a string `$str` containing digits (and possibly other characters which can be ignored). The last digit is the payload; consider it separately. Counting from the right, double the value of the first, third, etc. of the remaining digits.

For each value now greater than 9, sum its digits.

The correct check digit is that which, added to the sum of all values, would bring the total mod 10 to zero.

Return true if and only if the payload is equal to the correct check digit.

It was originally posted on [**reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/1faosv9/a_cool_guide_on_how_to_validate_credit_card/?rdt=51254).

#### Example 1

    Input: "17893729974"
    Output: true

    Payload is 4.

    Digits from the right:

    7 * 2 = 14, sum = 5
    9 = 9
    9 * 2 = 18, sum = 19
    2 = 2
    7 * 2 = 14, sum = 5
    3 = 3
    9 * 2 = 18, sum = 19
    8 = 8
    7 * 2 = 14, sum = 5
    1 = 1

    Sum of all values = 56, so 4 must be added to bring the total mod 10 to zero. The payload is indeed 4.

#### Example 2

    Input: "4137 8947 1175 5904"
    Output: true

#### Example 3

    Input: "4137 8974 1175 5904"
    Output: false
