# Get to know about Marton Polgar.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `PokGoPun`, the winner of **[June 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-06)**.

Today we are talking to `Marton Polgar`, the winner of **July 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Marton:** I started programming in `2011` in my high school years, as a hobby. Soon I found myself making tutorial videos about `Pascal` - probably I learned the most from them. :) Anyway, the hobby persisted and now here I am, at the age of 25, as a software engineer mostly using `C` and `Java` for work, finding excuses to mix in some `Raku`. :D

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using Raku? Have you used Perl before?

**Marton:** It all started a bit more than a year ago. I soon realized at work that scripting and text processing is essential to do certain tasks faster, however, it was quite obvious `POSIX shell` variants aren't close to my heart whatsoever. For some time, I kept mixing `Python` code with shell built-ins but I really found it uncomfortable; the interface is just cumbersome enough to be annoying for 5 liners. I somewhat blindly trusted `Perl` with solving this problem - and if `Perl` can do it, surely `Raku` can do it more elegantly... that's what I thought and I haven't been disproven yet. :) So I have spent a little over one year with `Raku`, skipping `Perl`.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Marton:** I think I first heard about it on the first `Raku Conference` last year. You were also there, weren't you? :) `Andrew Shitov` held a little review during that conference; however I only started later, probably after I started following the weekly Rakudo blog from `Elizabeth Mattijsen`. That's where I usually first see the challenges.

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Marton:** That they often revolve around math problems I find interesting. It's often easy to find a solution but there is always place for improvements, either with a more effective solution or more math applied on the problem. Often they aren't within reach with my rather rusty math knowledge but I like thinking about stuff like this.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Marton:** It depends on the week, really... I think the average would be around `2 hours`, thanks to those busy weeks when I just want to get it done. If we include the time for wondering around when there is an interesting arithmetic problem, well... there have been a couple of weeks with `8 hours` of thinking as well, probably. :)

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Marton:** Honestly, it rarely happens anymore - usually when I'm not satisfied with what I can come up with. Sometimes this hits back because `Raku` is really a big language and last time I saw others do these tasks, I immediately learned some things I hadn't used. `Jan Krnavek`'s solutions really gave me some inspiration at the beginning and it's always nice to compete with people like `Bruce Gray`. :)

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Marton:** It's okay to skip a task or a week. Also, there are many tasks to select from, all previous tasks are available and shareable. It's an honor that I became a champion in this competition and my conclusion is exactly that you can focus on your own learning and eventually this will pay off from the competitive perspective as well.

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Marton:** I would like to share my `Raku` experience of the last year - that's why I applied to this year's conference. :) Don't hesitate to check it out, along with presentations of the real creators of the community, among them are `Rakudo` developers `Johnathan Worthington`, `Vadim Belman` and `Elizabeth Mattijsen`, just to name a few. It doesn't get better than this. :D

That brings the end of the conversation with `Marton Polgar`. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
