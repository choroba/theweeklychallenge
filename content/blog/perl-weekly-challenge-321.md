## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #321` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

I would like to thank, `Eric Cheung` and `Vinod Kumar K` for prompt response with payment details. I am so happy that it's done and dusted.

Thank you, `VHukman`, for sharing solutions in a new programming language, [**Retro**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-320/hvukman/retro).

Thank you, `Roger Bell_West`, for sharing solutions in a new programming language, [**Typst**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-320/roger-bell-west/typst).

So, now we have contributions in `115` different guest languages as well as `Perl` and `Raku`.

I noticed, last week was the best week for guest contributions as compared to the last 5-weeks.

Having said, I am still waiting for the first `100+` contributions of the year `2025`.

`Happy Hacking!`

## Task 1: Distinct Average {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of numbers with even length.

Write a script to return the count of distinct average. The average is calculate by removing the minimum and the maximum, then average of the two.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @nums = (1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6)
    Output: 1

    Step 1: Min = 1, Max = 6, Avg = 3.5
    Step 2: Min = 2, Max = 5, Avg = 3.5
    Step 3: Min = 3, Max = 4, Avg = 3.5

    The count of distinct average is 1.

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @nums = (0, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5)
    Output: 2

    Step 1: Min = 0, Max = 8, Avg = 4
    Step 2: Min = 2, Max = 5, Avg = 3.5
    Step 3: Min = 3, Max = 4, Avg = 3.5

    The count of distinct average is 2.

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @nums = (7, 3, 1, 0, 5, 9)
    Output: 2

    Step 1: Min = 0, Max = 9, Avg = 4.5
    Step 2: Min = 1, Max = 7, Avg = 4
    Step 3: Min = 3, Max = 5, Avg = 4

    The count of distinct average is 2.

<br>

## Task 2: Backspace Compare {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two strings containing zero or more #.

Write a script to return true if the two given strings are same by treating # as backspace.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: $str1 = "ab#c"
           $str2 = "ad#c"
    Output: true

    For first string,  we remove "b" as it is followed by "#".
    For second string, we remove "d" as it is followed by "#".
    In the end both strings became the same.

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: $str1 = "ab##"
           $str2 = "a#b#"
    Output: true

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: $str1 = "a#b"
           $str2 = "c"
    Output: false
