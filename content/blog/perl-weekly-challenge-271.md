## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #271` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you. `Lance Wicks`, for yet another contribution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-270/lance-wicks/perl).

I would also like to thank, `Nelo Tovar`, for getting back to me with regard to the prize money. I replied to your email with a quick question. Please respond as soon as you find time and I will transfer the cash prize money to you.

Last week was a bit slow comparatively. Is it because of summer holiday period? Anyway, keep contributing and sharing the knowledge with your fellow team members.

## Task 1: Maximum Ones {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix.

Write a script to return the row number containing maximum ones, in case of more than one rows then return smallest row number.

#### Example 1

    Input: $matrix = [ [0, 1],
                       [1, 0],
                     ]
    Output: 1

    Row 1 and Row 2 have the same number of ones, so return row 1.

#### Example 2

    Input: $matrix = [ [0, 0, 0],
                       [1, 0, 1],
                     ]
    Output: 2

    Row 2 has the maximum ones, so return row 2.

#### Example 3

    Input: $matrix = [ [0, 0],
                       [1, 1],
                       [0, 0],
                     ]
    Output: 2

    Row 2 have the maximum ones, so return row 2.

<br>

## Task 2: Sort by 1 bits {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are give an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to sort the integers in `ascending order` by the number of `1 bits` in their binary representation. In case more than one integers have the same number of `1 bits` then sort them in `ascending order`.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
    Output: (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7)

    0 = 0 one bits
    1 = 1 one bits
    2 = 1 one bits
    4 = 1 one bits
    8 = 1 one bits
    3 = 2 one bits
    5 = 2 one bits
    6 = 2 one bits
    7 = 3 one bits

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1024, 512, 256, 128, 64)
    Output: (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)

    All integers in the given array have one 1-bits, so just sort them in ascending order.
