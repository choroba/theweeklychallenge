## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #320` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

This edition of the weekly challenge comes to you from `Germany` as I am attending the `Perl Toolchain Summit 2025` in `Leipzig`.

Since I will be traveling back home on `Sunday` night, there may be a few missing bits when the challenge goes live.

Don't worry, I'll patch things up by `Monday` afternoon once I've arrived home.

In the meantime, you've got the challenge to play with, so please keep the momentum going!

We're excited to welcome a new member, [**HVukman**](https://github.com/HVukman) to `Team PWC`.

Thank you, `HVukman`, for sharing your first contributions in [**K**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-319/hvukman/k).

Tomorrow marks the first `Monday` of the month and time for our monthly ritual!

I'm pleased to announce, `Vinod Kumar K`, as our next `Champion of the Month`.

A gentle reminder to last month's champion, `Eric Cheung`, I'm still waiting for `PayPal` details.

`Vinod` and `Eric`, please share your `PayPal` account information and preferred currency for the prize money.

Thank you, `Roger`, for adding another programming language, [**Typst**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-319/roger-bell-west/typst) to our list of guest languages. It looks simple and easy to use.

`Keep Hacking` and sharing knowledge!

## Task 1: Maximum Count {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to return the maximum between the number of positive and negative integers. Zero is neither positive nor negative.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3)
    Output: 3

    There are 3 positive integers.
    There are 3 negative integers.
    The maximum between 3 and 3 is 3.

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (-2, -1, 0, 0, 1)
    Output: 2

    There are 1 positive integers.
    There are 2 negative integers.
    The maximum between 2 and 1 is 2.

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
    Output: 4

    There are 4 positive integers.
    There are 0 negative integers.
    The maximum between 4 and 0 is 4.

<br>

## Task 2: Sum Difference {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers.

Write a script to return the absolute difference between digit sum and element sum of the given array.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 23, 4, 5)
    Output: 18

    Element sum: 1 + 23 + 4 + 5 => 33
    Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
    Absolute difference: | 33 - 15 | => 18

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: 0

    Element sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
    Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
    Absolute difference: | 15 - 15 | => 0

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 34)
    Output: 27

    Element sum: 1 + 2 + 34 => 37
    Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 => 10
    Absolute difference: | 37 - 10 | => 27
