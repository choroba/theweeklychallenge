## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #283` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Paulo Custodio`, for dealing with past weeks challenges. Kudos for your efforts. I know it is not easy and time consuming. It shows your love for `Perl`. It really motivates me to get back to taking part in the weekly challenge. I really miss those days when I used to contribute not in `Perl` but also in `Raku`, `Python`, `Java` and `Swift`. I even used to have time to blog about it. Those who are with us for long enough would remember that.

Thank you, `Santiago Leyva`, for sharing solution to `Task #1` of [**Week #281**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-281/santiago-leyva/perl/ch-1.pl). I always encourage everyone, please try not to skip the week. If you are too busy then atleast find time for one task. This will keep you motivated. For me personally, if I break the continuity then it is very hard to get back.

Welcome back, `Niels van Dijke` and thanks for your contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-282/perlboy1967/perl).

Thank you, `David Ferrone`, for sharing solutions in [**R**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-282/zapwai/r) for the first time. I hope and wish you continue alongwith other guest languages like `C`, `JavaScript`, `Python` and `Rust`.

Those who don't know about `Early Bird Club`, I want to inform you all that anyone can join the club by just sending one line email request. Once you join the club then you would get to try to the future challenges in advance. In return I would get your review to improve the task. This is very handy for me. I just throw challenges and request club member to review it for me. I get instant response from the club member most of the time. It has helped me in making task descriptive and easy to follow with good examples. If anyone interested to help me then they are more than welcome.

## Task 1: Unique Number {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`, where every elements appears more than once except one element.

Write a script to find the one element that appears exactly one time.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (3, 3, 1)
    Output: 1

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (3, 2, 4, 2, 4)
    Output: 3

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1)
    Output: 1

#### Example 4

    Input: @ints = (4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4)
    Output: 3

<br>

## Task 2: Digit Count Value {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return `true` if for every index `i` in the range `0 <= i < size of array`, the digit `i` occurs exactly the `$ints[$i]` times in the given array otherwise return `false`.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 1, 0)
    Ouput: true

    $ints[0] = 1, the digit 0 occurs exactly 1 time.
    $ints[1] = 2, the digit 1 occurs exactly 2 times.
    $ints[2] = 1, the digit 2 occurs exactly 1 time.
    $ints[3] = 0, the digit 3 occurs 0 time.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (0, 3, 0)
    Ouput: false

    $ints[0] = 0, the digit 0 occurs 2 times rather than 0 time.
    $ints[1] = 3, the digit 1 occurs 0 time rather than 3 times.
    $ints[2] = 0, the digit 2 occurs exactly 0 time.
