# Get to know about Stephen G. Lynn.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Marton Polgar`, the winner of **[July 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-07)**.

Today we are talking to `Stephen G. Lynn`, the winner of **August 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Stephen:** I am a non-CS academic, mostly teaching-focused these days. I have used mostly `SAS`, `R` or `SPlus`, and `Matlab` or its clones for my academic research in the past.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using Perl and Raku?

**Stephen:** I have used `Perl` regularly since the early 90's, since before `Perl 5` was released. I mostly have used it for data munging or text processing tasks. I started trying out `Raku/Perl6` more recently, around a year ago.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stephen:** I enjoy it a lot. Thanks for coming up with this. I can't think of any particular feature that I like most, it's all good.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stephen:** I could spend more time on it in my summer break, now I have less time unfortunately. Probably I spend around three hours a week on average, though sometimes it could be a lot more.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Stephen:** Yes, I check out other solutions regularly and even mention them in my blog. I liked `Philippe Bricout's` regex-based one-liners best.

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Stephen:** I would suggest that `Math::Prime::Util::GMP` is their friend for the number-theory challenges.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Stephen:**  Can't think of anything offhand. Thanks again for the weekly challenge.
