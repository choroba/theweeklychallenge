## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #315` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let's all welcome, [**Ashwin Shenoy**](https://github.com/UltraInstinct05), from `India` to `Team PWC`. Thanks `Ashwin` for your first contributions in [**Dart**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-314/ashwin-shenoy/dart) and [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-314/ashwin-shenoy/python).

Thank you, `E. Choroba`, for getting back to me with `PayPal` details. I am glad the payment is now done. It has been waiting since `November 2024`. I am now waiting for one more member, `Laurent Rosenfeld`, to please share your details as well.

`Ramadan` is over now. Hopefully I'll have more energy and time to put in.

The weather in `England` is getting better for the last few days. I can't wait for the `summer`. I have had enough of `winter`.

I have taken a day off work today, so that I can spend some quality time with my family and celebrate the `Idd` festival.

I wish `Idd Mubarak` to all team members who celebrate the festival.

You all have a wonderful `Monday` to start the week.

Please continue hacking and sharing.
