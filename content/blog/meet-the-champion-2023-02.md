# Get to know about Solathian

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `Bob Lied`, the winner of **January 2023**.

Today we are talking to `Solathian`, the winner of **February 2023** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Solathian:** I'm an `Electrical Egineer` working as an embedded SW developer in the Automotive industry. I work mostly with `C` and `CAPL`. I dabble in `Python`. I write `Perl` tools amidst my colleagues silent screams. But I swear it's not because I write instant legacy code, they just prefer `Python` over `Perl`.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Solathian:** When I started working here at my current company `3 years ago`. I was tasked with creating a module into an existing framework. The whole framework was written in `Perl`. It was `Perl v5.14`. The module generated `Excel` documetation based on an already existing large hash. I had to fetch data from an `SQL server` and had to parse `C` header files for info. I had little to no knowledge of the language and yes that was my first task during the probation. Well it turned out alright. Currently I'm kind of a `Perl` expert at the company, but I do know that I still have a long way to go.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Solathian:** Maybe from `Gábor Szabó`'s [**newsletter**](https://perlweekly.com).

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Solathian:** I like to check out other people's solutions and even now I can learn of new modules methods etc.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Solathian:** Depends on the task, sometimes I like to experiment with it. Sometimes I finish it in like `10 minutes`. So basically `10min - ~1hour`.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Solathian:** Yes, I always check out all of the `Perl` solutions. If I don't then I always check out `Peter Campbell Smith`'s solutions. I do not know why, maybe because he looks like an experienced guy.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Solathian:** Check out other people's solutions many things can be learnt.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Solathian:** I have to admit that I like regular expressions. I'm not an expert, though.
