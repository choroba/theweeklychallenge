# Get to know about Nelo Tovar

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `Kjetil Skotheim`, the winner of **December 2023**.

Today we are talking to `Nelo Tovar`, the winner of **January 2024** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Nelo:** I graduated as a Computer Engineer from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu.ve) (Barquisimeto - Venezuela) in Nov/1992. I wrote my first program in `UCSD Pascal` on an `Apple IIe` and I have also programmed in `Basic` and `Clipper`. I currently work as a devops and cloud engineer.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Nelo:** I started using `Perl` in `2000`, I was working as a `Unix sysadmin` and we needed to replicate data from `12` remote databases to a local repository. The tool we were using to do this replication often failed, so I wrote a `Perl` script to do the data replication. This script was used for `3 years` when  the database infrastructure changed to a centralized schema.
