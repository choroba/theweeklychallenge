## Journey to the Event
***

My journey began at `12 PM` on `Wednesday, April 30th`. I took a bus to `Heathrow Airport` to catch my flight to `Berlin` via `Frankfurt` with `Lufthansa Airline`.
The entire journey was a pleasant experience, except for one part: I had to exit the `Frankfurt` airport and re-enter to catch my connecting flight to `Berlin`. I had assumed I could simply switch planes without leaving the airport.

<br>

## Day 1
***

I reached the hotel at `6 AM` on `Thursday` morning, the first day of the event.

    </div>
</div>

<br>

At breakfast, I met many guests, `Salve` was the first among them. I also met `Ruth` again; it was lovely to see her after the `Toronto` conference. I met `Todd` for the first time as well.

That day, I had the chance to meet the `MetaCPAN` team: `Olaf`, `Graham`, `Mickie` and `Shawn`. I’ve always wanted to contribute to `MetaCPAN`, and this was finally my opportunity. I had to start from scratch by setting up the local `MetaCPAN` web environment.

I was given the link to the `MetaCPAN Docker GitHub` repository: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-docker.git**

It was just a matter of a quick `clone`, `init`, and `docker compose up`. In no time, I had a working local `MetaCPAN` web interface on my laptop.

<br>

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-docker.git
$ cd metacpan-docker/
$ bin/metacpan-docker init
$ docker compose up web-server
```

<br>

The local instance of `MetaCPAN` was now accessible: **http://localhost:5001**

I took a quick glance at the codebase and its structure: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web**

Two important areas: [**Library**](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/tree/master/lib/MetaCPAN) and [**Template**](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/tree/master/root)

My first issue of the day: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3235**

I had to explore the codebase extensively to find the right spot. It was a fun exercise involving both the `MetaCPAN` web and `API` components.

Unfortunately, I only had the web interface running locally, not the `API`, which made debugging the `API` side difficult.

In this setup, my local web instance was making `API` calls to the production environment.

I spent some time on the issue but didn’t get close to resolving it.

`Olaf` suggested I pick another issue in the meantime.

So I chose this one, a pure templating issue with no `API` involvement: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3079**

Understanding the code structure was an enjoyable exercise.

I resolved the issue in my local environment and submitted my first pull request of the day: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3326**

It was kindly approved and merged by `Olaf`.

Lunch was organized at the hotel by the `PTS Organiser`. It was great to see so many people in one place.

After lunch, I worked on this issue: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3278**

This was another front-end-only issue. The `BackPAN` link was empty and simply pointed to the current page.

The easy fix was to provide the necessary data to the template.

I did exactly that in this pull request: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3327**

`Graham` quickly suggested that this should be handled in the `API` rather than the frontend layer. He even provided an alternate fix.

So this one didn’t go through—but that’s okay. I was learning from every issue.

In the evening, some of us went to a `Lebanese` restaurant for dinner. The wait was long, but it was worth it, the food was excellent.

<br>

## Day 2
***

I met `Stig` from the `CPAN Security Group` and had a discussion about `CVEs`.

It was reassuring to know there’s a dedicated team handling `CVE-related` matters.

My first issue of the day was: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3044**

Nice and easy, got the pull request ready in no time: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3331**

Thanks to `Olaf` for accepting and quick merge.

It was great to see my change live instantly.

My second issue was: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3108**

Pull request for the same was ready for review: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3332**

Once again, `Olaf`, approved and merged the changes.

In the evening, `Daniel`, one of the organisers, gave us a city tour.

    </div>

<br>

It was tiring but well worth it. There was so much to see—beautiful buildings and open spaces.

Dinner was sponsored by the `PTS Organiser` in a lovely restaurant. I sat with `Olaf` and `Todd`. The food wasn’t exactly to my taste, but the company made up for it. After dinner, `Mickey`, `Shawn` and I decided to walk back to the hotel. On the way, I met `Doug`, it was my first time meeting him in person, though we had interacted over email in the past. It was nice chatting with him on the way back.

During the city tour, someone suggested I should better create map for `Leipzig Railway Network` while I am here.

After the dinner, I couldn't sleep as the idea was burning inside me. I decided to do quick search if I can get hold of `Leipzig Railway Network` data.

Luckily I found one, although I couldn't cover the entire network, I managed to do just two lines and published it before going to bed: [**Map::Tube::Leipzig**](https://metacpan.org/dist/Map-Tube-Leipzig)

<br>

## Day 3
***

At breakfast, I met `Ferenc Erki` and had a very interesting conversation. `Garu` also joined us and introduced himself, it was my first time meeting him. He seemed like a very friendly guy.

For lunch, `Olaf`, `Shawn`, `Graham`, `Mickie`, `Salve`, `Jordan` and I went to a nearby Doner kebab place. The food was absolutely delicious.

After lunch, `Graham` kindly helped me get the `API Docker` container testing successfully locally.

I needed this to investigate the earlier issue: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3235**

It turned out that the `API` was returning the full dataset, but the frontend was limiting the result size. That’s why the complete list wasn’t visible.

The ideal solution would be to implement pagination, rather than showing everything on one page.

For now, `Graham` and I increased the limit to `500` items to resolve the issue.

I also learned a few tricks for working with the local `API`, thanks to `Graham` something that will definitely help me in the future.

This is the pull request that finally resolved the issue: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3337**

Another quick issue for the day: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/2912**

Corresponding pull request for the same: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3340**

`Daniel` also helped me book the train ticket from `Leipzig` to `Berlin Airport`.

<br>

## Day 4
***

At the breakfast table, I was joined by `Todd`. I also met `Ruth` again, and we exchanged a warm hug.

This was the last day of the event—time to fly back. My anxiety started to kick in.

I tried to take it slow and worked on this issue after a quick breakfast: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/2861**

And submitted the following pull request: **https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/pull/3344**

Later it turned out to be throwing warning in the log for some other pages.

I decided to change it to `draft` as suggested by `Olaf`.

I will look at it at some point in time.

## Future Plan
***

My attendance of `PTS 2025` wasn't planned. It just came as a surprise for me. I didn't get time to prepare anything for the event. Now that I have experienced and seen how others had planned, I'll definitely be better prepared if I get invited again.

I am definitely going to continue work on `MetaCPAN` project as and when I find spare time. I don't want to break the continuity. I noticed `Elastic Search` is heavily used in `MetaCPAN`. I will brush up my `Elastic Search` knowledge so that I can contribute in that area too.
