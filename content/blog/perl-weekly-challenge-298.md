## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #298` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome a new guest contributor, [**Dorian 'vxern' Oszczeda**](https://github.com/vxern) to `Team PWC`. Thank you, `Dorian`, for sharing your first contributions in [**Uiua**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-297/vxern/uiua).

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the next champion. We are proud to announce, `E. Choroba`, once again the champion of the month. Thank you for the being the most consistent contributor. You have been one of the greatest `Perl` enthusiasts in the `Team PWC`. Congratulation once again.

Finally we entered the festive month of `Advent Calendar`. For many, it is the time to reflect on past whole year achievements, good or bad. But for me, it is completely opposite, I just want it go away as quickly as possible. In fact, personally the time between the start of `October` and end of `January` period is the most scariest time. I am lucky so far this time, I survived the initial two months. I am hoping the remaining two months would go without any trouble. I wish you all a very happy festive month.

I would like to mention a very kind gesture by some members who regularly writes kind and motivating words to me. It is a private conversation otherwise I would have shared the message. Please accept my apology for never reply to your message. I do appreciate your kind efforts. Your words bring a big smile on my face every time. I am very emotional person by nature and find it hard to control when it comes to showing in public. I rather keep it private. May be one day when I meet in person then I can share my feelings.

The month of `December` is always the busiest time of the year because of daily post of `Advent Calendar`. Having said, I do enjoy going back and revisit the coolest work of the team members.

## Task 1: Maximal Square {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix with `0` and `1` only.

Write a script to find the largest square containing only `1's` and return it's area.

#### Example 1

    Input: @matrix = ([1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                      [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
                      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                      [1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
    Output: 4

    Two maximal square found with same size marked as 'x':

    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    [1, 0, x, x, 1]
    [1, 1, x, x, 1]
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
    [1, 0, 1, x, x]
    [1, 1, 1, x, x]
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

#### Example 2

    Input: @matrix = ([0, 1],
                      [1, 0])
    Output: 1

    Two maximal square found with same size marked as 'x':

    [0, x]
    [1, 0]


    [0, 1]
    [x, 0]

#### Example 3

    Input: @matrix = ([0])
    Output: 0

<br>

## Task 2: Right Interval {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of `@intervals`, where `$intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is unique.

The right interval for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `startj >= endi` and `startj` is minimized. Please note that `i` may equal `j`.

Write a script to return an array of right interval indices for each interval `i`. If no right interval exists for interval `i`, then put `-1` at index `i`.

#### Example 1

    Input: @intervals = ([3,4], [2,3], [1,2])
    Output: (-1, 0, 1)

    There is no right interval for [3,4].
    The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
    The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.

#### Example 2

    Input: @intervals = ([1,4], [2,3], [3,4])
    Output: (-1, 2, -1)

    There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
    The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.

#### Example 3

    Input: @intervals = ([1,2])
    Output: (-1)

    There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

#### Example 4

    Input: @intervals = ([1,4], [2, 2], [3, 4])
    Output: (-1, 1, -1)
