# Get to know about Robert Ransbottom.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Matthew Neleigh`, the winner of **[April 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-04)**.

Today we are talking to `Robert Ransbottom`, the winner of **May 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Robert:** I read most of a brief computing-101-ish book at a book store one afternoon. I have read a little more since.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using Raku? Have you used Perl before?

**Robert:** There was some management interest in computerizing the workplace's paperwork. I thought some small unix variant seemed like the only reasonable platform that could be scaled up if ever necessary. I got sent home with a luggable and `SCO Xenix` to learn about. So I learned how to use and SA re-branded unix and to munge data with `sh`, `sed` and `awk`.

I went down the rabbit hole and it became a hobby since the intention to computerize faded away. But the munging got me into `Perl`, and trying to write larger scripts got me out of Perl until strict put a collar on that cur, Auto-vivification.

Before `Perl 5`, I learnt mostly `C`, `C++`, `Sather` and `CRUDdy SQL`. Since 5, I focused on `Perl` and `SQL`; until in the last couple of years, my attention has been on learning `Raku`. I was interested in `Perl 6` from its announcement, gleening what I might from the synopses, etc.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:**  I don't recall precisely, two people mentioned it shortly before I started.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** The `Perl` and `Raku` focus.

The tension in some challenges amongst the general task scaled up, the specific task as sized, and the occasional need to provide some justification or specific presentation.

Lacking much math, I sometimes appreciate the opportunity to learn some. I enjoy seeing people here of whom I have a good opinion from my being in the fringe of the `Perl` community. It is nice compare my work against some excellent work. Less important at present but enjoyable: learning about other languages is facilitated by looking solutions to problems which you have solved.

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** I have gone up to `16 hours` with rewrites. I am usually in the `4 to 8 hour` range. I would not affirm I `"dedicate time"` to the WC, but since I use it as a tool to learn `Raku`, I won't deny it either. Time may be spent scouring the docs for a feature or syntax (and chasing other 'shiny's that come to view). In 166's `K-Directory Diff`, I spent a lot of time looking for features to eliminate tedious code. Here 'tedious code' is intertwined, loopy code with fence posts that are not obviously on the property line. I did succeed in transforming tedious code, but only into other tedious code.

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Robert:**  I do but not always. As of yet, I have not developed favorites, mostly I look for alternate ways to dissect the problem, good phrasing, and epiphanies.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:**  Have fun and recognize you are your best competitor.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Robert:**  Yes, let me get this off my chest: If all you have is a hammer and everything looks like a nail, you don't know much about hammers.

That brings the end of the conversation with `Robert Ransbottom`. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
