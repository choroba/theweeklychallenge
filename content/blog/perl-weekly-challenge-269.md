## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #269` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

One more language, `Nu`, added to the guest lanuages, thanks to `Asher Harvey-Smith`. You can find the solution to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-268/asherbhs/nu/ch-1.nu) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-268/asherbhs/nu/ch-2.nu) in `Nu`.

Talking about guest language, we have received solution to [**Task #1**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-268/roger-bell-west/crystal/ch-1.cr) and [**Task #2**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-268/roger-bell-west/crystal/ch-2.cr) in `Crystal`, thanks to `Roger Bell_West`.

I would like to apologise in delay last week as I am fighting with `Hayfever`. I will try to catch up in the next few days.

## Task 1: Bitwise OR {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of positive integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find out if it is possible to select two or more elements of the given array such that the bitwise OR of the selected elements has atlest one trailing zero in its binary representation.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: true

    Say, we pick 2 and 4, thier bitwise OR is 6. The binary representation of 6 is 110.
    Return true since we have one trailing zero.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 3, 8, 16)
    Output: true

    Say, we pick 2 and 8, thier bitwise OR is 10. The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
    Return true since we have one trailing zero.

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 5, 7, 9)
    Output: false

<br>

## Task 2: Distribute Elements {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of distinct integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to distribute the elements as described below:

    1) Put the 1st element of the given array to a new array @arr1.
    2) Put the 2nd element of the given array to a new array @arr2.

Once you have one element in each arrays, `@arr1` and `@arr2`, then follow the rule below:

    If the last element of the array @arr1 is greater than the last
    element of the array @arr2 then add the first element of the
    given array to @arr1 otherwise to the array @arr2.

When done distribution, return the concatenated arrays. `@arr1` and `@arr2`.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)

    1st operation:
    Add 1 to @arr1 = (2)

    2nd operation:
    Add 2 to @arr2 = (1)

    3rd operation:
    Now the last element of @arr1 is greater than the last element
    of @arr2, add 3 to @arr1 = (2, 3).

    4th operation:
    Again the last element of @arr1 is greate than the last element
    of @arr2, add 4 to @arr1 = (2, 3, 4)

    5th operation:
    Finally, the last element of @arr1 is again greater than the last
    element of @arr2, add 5 to @arr1 = (2, 3, 4, 5)

    Mow we have two arrays:
    @arr1 = (2, 3, 4, 5)
    @arr2 = (1)

    Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (2, 3, 4, 5, 1).

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (3, 2, 4)
    Output: (3, 4, 2)

    1st operation:
    Add 1 to @arr1 = (3)

    2nd operation:
    Add 2 to @arr2 = (2)

    3rd operation:
    Now the last element of @arr1 is greater than the last element
    of @arr2, add 4 to @arr1 = (3, 4).

    Mow we have two arrays:
    @arr1 = (3, 4)
    @arr2 = (2)

    Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (3, 4, 2).

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (5, 4, 3 ,8)
    Output: (5, 3, 4, 8)

    1st operation:
    Add 1 to @arr1 = (5)

    2nd operation:
    Add 2 to @arr2 = (4)

    3rd operation:
    Now the last element of @arr1 is greater than the last element
    of @arr2, add 3 to @arr1 = (5, 3).

    4th operation:
    Again the last element of @arr2 is greate than the last element
    of @arr1, add 8 to @arr2 = (4, 8)

    Mow we have two arrays:
    @arr1 = (5, 3)
    @arr2 = (4, 8)

    Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (5, 3, 4, 8).
