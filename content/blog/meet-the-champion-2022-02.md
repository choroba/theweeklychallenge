# Get to know about Robert DiCicco.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Alexander Pankoff`, the winner of **[January 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-01)**.

Today we are talking to `Robert DiCicco`, the winner of **February 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Robert:** I started back in the dark ages, **1986**. I took a job as a `System Administrator` at a publishing company. I was left with a **Unix** box and a list of software that they wanted. I eventually ended up doing everything in **C** and **shell**. It was also a great **Unix** learning experience. Over the years I picked up **Python**, **SQL**, **Bash**, **Ruby** and **Tcl**. I eventually got my degree from an online university.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Robert:** A friend of mine took a look at all of this **C** code and shell scripting I was doing, and said `"Why aren't you using perl?"`. When I saw how cool it was, I was blown away. It became my number one tool. I eventually took a job with a large cell phone service provider, and **Perl** remained my primary language, along with **Python**, **Bash** and **SQL**.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** I was looking for something about **Perl** in Google, and saw it. I was interested and after a few months decided to give it a try.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** I like the idea that this is a place for people who really love programming. I am amazed by how skilled everyone is. I usually check out the code submissions looking for better ways to do things.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** Well, I am retired so I have a lot of time. I usually spend two days on the problems. I am also trying to learn **Raku**, and I pore over all of the **Raku** entries. I think it will eventually be my primary language, if I can get better at it. Most of the **Raku** stuff I turn in is not that good, but it does work! I can only hope to become better at programming in **Raku**.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Robert:** Yes, I check out all **Raku** submissions. My favorite is `Laurent Rosenfeld`. Not only does he know his stuff, but he is able to convey the information clearly in his blog. I always feel like I've learned something after checking out his blog posts. I also follow Gabor Szabo for perl stuff. And I go through the **Perl** submissions.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Robert:** Take a shot at the problems. Check out the submissions and see how people solved them. It is a great way to learn.

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Robert:** I would like to thank you for the `PWC`. And I would like to thank everyone else for providing me a great learning opportunity.
