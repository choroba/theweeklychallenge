# Get to know about Mariano Spadaccini

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `Avery Adams`, the winner of **[June 2023](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-06)**.

Today we are talking to `Mariano Spadaccini`, the winner of **July 2023** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Mariano:** From age `10 to 14`I loved programming in `Basic 1.0` on `CPC 464`. Some were nice programs for a little boy, the last one was too big for the memory (nominal `64kB`) :-(
After some programming at school, `2 years` in `Pascal` (only a few hours a month), the last three years in computer science course (essentialy programming in `COBOL` and other languages, intro in operating system, ...). But in the last year I got acquanted in the school laboratory with Internet, so my thirst for IT knowledge has significantly increased.
At university little computer science, but a lot of mathematics, physics and electronics. In any case I had discovered the Internet, so I was passionate about `GNU/Linux` and `Networking` which I cultivated as much as possible.
Over the last `20 years` I have often changed jobs, especially as a systems engineer, but also as a backend programmer (now I do both).

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Mariano:** The first contact occurred in school lavoratory (`~1998/99`) through `CGI programming`, but I wrote the first professional script in `2005` as `System Administrator`. The most important online resources were `PerlMonks`, but I liked reading the books `Beginning Perl`, `Learning Perl`, `Intermediate Perl`, ...

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Mariano:** I think via Gabor Szabo/Mohammad Anwar's [**Perl Weekly**](https://perlweekly.com) newsletter.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Mariano:** I really like. When I have a little more time, I write solutions in multiple languages, and it is nice to face problems with different approaches.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Mariano:** I always try to carve out some time to tackle the challenges in `Perl`, I would say between `20` and `40` minutes, but if I can I also dedicate a few hours with other programming languages. And if with `Perl` my first aim is to have fun, I admit that I also use challenges to try my hand at other languages. Surely the next one will be `Rust`.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Mariano:** I usually do not see other solutions, but `Monday` or `Tuesday` I read `PerlWeekly` and sometimes come across nice posts. And yes, among these there are algorithmically interesting solutions. In this intersection, I often read the blogs of `Flavio Poletti`, `Luis Mochan`, `Roger Bell West`.

**Mariano:** Thanks to all of you for the effort and for the interesting problems always there waiting for us!!
