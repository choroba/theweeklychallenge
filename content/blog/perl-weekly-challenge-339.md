## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #339` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Once again, the quality of guest contributions continues to improve week after week and the blog posts are maintaining their high standard.

I've noticed that `Rust` continues to rise and is soon expected to surpass `1000` contributions while `Python` continues to maintain it's `#1` rank.

I'd like to call on all `Raku` fans to give us another push. We are fortunate to have dedicated `Raku` contributors like `Andrew Shitov`, `Arne Sommer`, `BarrOff`, `Simon Proctor`. I also believe our dedicated `Perl` masters should give `Raku` a try.

There was a time when I regularly contributed in `Perl`, `Raku`, `Python` and `Swift`. I even blogged about it. May be, it's high time I got back in the game.

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Max Diff {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers having four or more elements.

Write a script to find two pairs of numbers from this list (four numbers total) so that the difference between their products is as large as possible.

In the end return the max difference.

> With Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d), the product difference is (a * b) - (c * d).

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (5, 9, 3, 4, 6)
    Output: 42

    Pair 1: (9, 6)
    Pair 2: (3, 4)
    Product Diff: (9 * 6) - (3 * 4) => 54 - 12 => 42

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1, -2, 3, -4)
    Output: 10

    Pair 1: (1, -2)
    Pair 2: (3, -4)

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (-3, -1, -2, -4)
    Output: 10

    Pair 1: (-1, -2)
    Pair 2: (-3, -4)

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @ints = (10, 2, 0, 5, 1)
    Output: 50

    Pair 1: (10, 5)
    Pair 2: (0, 1)

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @ints = (7, 8, 9, 10, 10)
    Output: 44

    Pair 1: (10, 10)
    Pair 2: (7, 8)

<br>

## Task 2: Peak Point {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of altitude gain.

Write a script to find the peak point gained.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @gain = (-5, 1, 5, -9, 2)
    Output: 1

    start: 0
    1st change:  0 + (-5) = -5
    2nd change: -5 + 1    = -4
    3rd change: -4 + 5    = 1
    4th change:  1 + (-9) = -8
    5th change: -8 + 2    = -6

    max(0, -5, -4, 1, -8, -6) = 1

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @gain = (10, 10, 10, -25)
    Output: 30

    start: 0
    1st change:  0 + 10    = 10
    2nd change: 10 + 10    = 20
    3rd change: 20 + 10    = 30
    4th change: 30 + (-25) = 5

    max(0, 10, 20, 30, 5) = 30

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @gain = (3, -4, 2, 5, -6, 1)
    Output: 6

    start: 0
    1st change:  0 + 3    = 3
    2nd change:  3 + (-4) = -1
    3rd change: -1 + 2    = 1
    4th change:  1 + 5    = 6
    5th change:  6 + (-6) = 0
    6th change:  0 + 1    = 1

    max(0, 3, -1, 1, 6, 0, 1) = 6

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @gain = (-1, -2, -3, -4)
    Output: 0

    start: 0
    1st change:  0 + (-1) = -1
    2nd change: -1 + (-2) = -3
    3rd change: -3 + (-3) = -6
    4th change: -6 + (-4) = -10

    max(0, -1, -3, -6, -10) = 0
<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @gain = (-10, 15, 5)
    Output: 10

    start: 0
    1st change:   0 + (-10) = -10
    2nd change: -10 + 15    = 5
    3rd change:   5 + 5     = 10

    max(0, -10, 5, 10) = 10
