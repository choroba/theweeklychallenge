## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}

Welcome to the `Week #285` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

First thing first, today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare the next champion. With great pleasure, I announce `Mariano Ortega` as the next `Champion of the Month`. He is fairly new addition to `Team PWC`. He joined the team in the `Week #277`. As of today he shared `14` solutions in `Perl`. I will send you email with regard to the prize money, please keep an eye in your mailbox and respond asap.

Just a gentle reminder to `Andrew Schneider`, I am still waiting for your response to my email dated `5th Aug 2024` with regard to prize money. Please reply when you get time.

Let us all welcome two new `Perl` hackers, [**Torgny Lyon**](https://github.com/torgnylyon) and [**Tim King**](https://github.com/JTimothyKing). With this we now have `315` members and of those, `17` never contributed even once.

Thank you, `Peter Meszaros`, for still carrying on dealing with past challenges in `Perl`.

Thank you, `Paulo Custodio`, for finally getting done with all the past challenges in `Perl`. Right now, I noticed you are dealing with them in `Python`. Good luck and all the very best.

I also noticed handy scripts shared by `Paulo`. I would suggest you take a closer look e.g. [[**stats.pl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-001/paulo-custodio/stats.pl)] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [[**check_challenge_title.pl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-001/paulo-custodio/check_challenge_title.pl)] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [[**go.pl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-001/paulo-custodio/go.pl)] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [[**test.pl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-001/paulo-custodio/test.pl)].

Welcome back, `Andrezgz` and thanks for sharing solutions to `Week #283` in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-283/andrezgz/perl).

## Task 1: No Connection {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of routes, `@routes`.

Write a script to find the destination with no further outgoing connection.

#### Example 1

    Input: @routes = (["B","C"], ["D","B"], ["C","A"])
    Output: "A"

    "D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".
    "B" -> "C" -> "A".
    "C" -> "A".
    "A".

#### Example 2

    Input: @routes = (["A","Z"])
    Output: "Z"

<br>

## Task 2: Making Change {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [David Ferrone](http://www.zapwai.net)
***

Compute the number of ways to make change for given amount in cents. By using the coins e.g. `Penny`, `Nickel`, `Dime`, `Quarter` and `Half-dollar`, in how many distinct ways can the total value equal to the given amount? Order of coin selection does not matter.

    A penny (P) is equal to 1 cent.
    A nickel (N) is equal to 5 cents.
    A dime (D) is equal to 10 cents.
    A quarter (Q) is equal to 25 cents.
    A half-dollar (HD) is equal to 50 cents.

#### Example 1

    Input: $amount = 9
    Ouput: 2

    1: 9P
    2: N + 4P

#### Example 2

    Input: $amount = 15
    Ouput: 6

    1: D + 5P
    2: D + N
    3: 3N
    4: 2N + 5P
    5: N + 10P
    6: 15P

#### Example 3

    Input: $amount = 100
    Ouput: 292
