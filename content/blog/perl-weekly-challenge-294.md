## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #294` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and time to declare our next champion. With great pride, I declare `Santiago Leyva` as the `Champion of the Month`. He joined the `Team PWC` in the `Week #272`. As of today, he has contributed `35` solutions in `Perl`.

`Hacktoberfest` just finished and I hope many of the `Team PWC` members must have completed the challenge of completing the minimum number of pull requests required as part of the challenge. Unfortunately I didn't take part because of lack of time.

`What next now?`

Well, to me, it must be the `Advent Calendar 2024`. Those who are with us long enough knows the tradition. Having said, I would like to propose a new idea this time. Please let me know what you think. The idea is we prepare `25 entries` for the `Advent Calendar` where each entry would be about `10-15 minutes` long video shared by `Team PWC` talking about their experience so far with the weekly challenge or anything they want to talk about any aspects they want. I am not particular about the format, feel free to share your suggestions. It would be a big surprise to all of us, in my humble opinion.

Please do share your ideas if you have any to make it fun and unique.

## Task 1: Consecutive Sequence {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an unsorted array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Return -1 if none found. The algorithm must runs in `O(n)` time.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (10, 4, 20, 1, 3, 2)
    Output: 4

    The longest consecutive sequence (1, 2, 3, 4).
    The length of the sequence is 4.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (0, 6, 1, 8, 5, 2, 4, 3, 0, 7)
    Output: 9

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (10, 30, 20)
    Output: -1

<br>

## Task 2: Next Permutation {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find out the next permutation of the given array.

> The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3)
    Output: (1, 3, 2)

    Permutations of (1, 2, 3) arranged lexicographically:
    (1, 2, 3)
    (1, 3, 2)
    (2, 1, 3)
    (2, 3, 1)
    (3, 1, 2)
    (3, 2, 1)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3)
    Output: (2, 3, 1)

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (3, 1, 2)
    Output: (3, 2, 1)
