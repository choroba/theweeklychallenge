## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #277` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us welcome new member, `Mariano Ortega`, an experl `Perl` hacker from `Argentina`. He shared his first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/mgo1977/perl).

We have been surprised by `Ryan Thompson` contribution this week. For the first time, he shared solutions in [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/ryan-thompson/python) alongwith his regular [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/ryan-thompson/perl) as well. We even had bonus [**blog post**](https://ry.ca/2024/07/pwc-276-complete-day-and-maximum-frequency).

Welcome back `Kai Burgdof` and thanks for sharing solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/kai-burgdorf/perl) and [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/kai-burgdorf/javascript).

We had another surprise by `Kjetil Skotheim` as he shared solutions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-276/kjetillll/perl). Not only this, he also shared solutions to the [**Week #271**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-271/kjetillll/perl) and [**Week #273**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-273/kjetillll/perl). It feels great when I see member sharing past week solutions.

I would also like to mention one more member, `Andrew Schneider`, who never miss the opportunity to surprise us every week. I really enjoy his choice of guest languages every week. There is a surprise element attach to it. On top, the [**blog post**](https://github.com/atschneid/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-276/atschneid/README.md) is worth checking out.

Thank you, `Team PWC`, for your contributions and encouragements.

## Task 1: Count Common {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two array of strings, `@words1` and `@words2`.

Write a script to return the count of words that appears in both arrays exactly once.

#### Example 1

    Input: @words1 = ("Perl", "is", "my", "friend")
           @words2 = ("Perl", "and", "Raku", "are", "friend")
    Output: 2

    The words "Perl" and "friend" appear once in each array.

#### Example 2

    Input: @words1 = ("Perl", "and", "Python", "are", "very", "similar")
           @words2 = ("Python", "is", "top", "in", "guest", "languages")
    Output: 1

#### Example 3

    Input: @words1 = ("Perl", "is", "imperative", "Lisp", "is", "functional")
           @words2 = ("Crystal", "is", "similar", "to", "Ruby")
    Output: 0

<br>

## Task 2: Strong Pair {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

 Write a script to return the count of all strong pairs in the given array.

>  A pair of integers x and y is called strong pair if it satisfies: 0 < |x - y| < min(x, y).

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Ouput: 4

    Strong Pairs: (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (5, 7, 1, 7)
    Ouput: 1

    Strong Pairs: (5, 7)
