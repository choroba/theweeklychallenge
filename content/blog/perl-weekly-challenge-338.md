## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #338` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thanks `Thomas Kohler` and `Simon Proctor` for confirming your acceptance of the prize money.

Thanks `VHukman` for sharing your [**Racket**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-337/hvukman/racket) solutions for the first time.

Welcome back, `Dave Jacoby`, after your short break. Thank you for your consistently high quality contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-337/dave-jacoby/perl) and your excellent [**blog post**](https://jacoby-lpwk.onrender.com/2025/09/05/i-never-go-far-without-a-little-big-star-weekly-challenge-337.html).

Looking at the stats from the past five weeks, I've noticed a dip in `Raku` contributions.

Although, `Perl` isn't as dominant as it once was, it's still holding its ground well, in my humble opinion.

I've also seen a rise in the quality blog post from the team. So a big `Thank You` to each and every one of you.

The guest contributions never disappoint, we consistently get `50+` every single week.

It's always nice to see familiar names regularly sharing their knowledge with us.

<br>

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Highest Row {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a `m x n` matrix.

Write a script to find the highest row sum in the given matrix.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @matrix = ([4,  4, 4, 4],
                      [10, 0, 0, 0],
                      [2,  2, 2, 9])
    Output: 16

    Row 1: 4  + 4 + 4 + 4 => 16
    Row 2: 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 => 10
    Row 3: 2  + 2 + 2 + 9 => 15

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @matrix = ([1, 5],
                      [7, 3],
                      [3, 5])
    Output: 10

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @matrix = ([1, 2, 3],
                      [3, 2, 1])
    Output: 6

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @matrix = ([2, 8, 7],
                      [7, 1, 3],
                      [1, 9, 5])
    Output: 17

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @matrix = ([10, 20,  30],
                      [5,  5,   5],
                      [0,  100, 0],
                      [25, 25,  25])
    Output: 100

<br>

## Task 2: Max Distance {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two integer arrays, `@arr1` and `@arr2`.

Write a script to find the maximum difference between any pair of values from both arrays.

    Input: @arr1 = (4, 5, 7)
           @arr2 = (9, 1, 3, 4)

    | 4 - 9 | = 5
    | 4 - 1 | = 3

    | 4 - 4 | = 0
    max distance = 5

    With element $arr1[1] = 5
    | 5 - 9 | = 4
