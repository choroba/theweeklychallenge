The unary `+` operator in `Perl` has a very specific and important purpose but it is quite different from its behavior in languages like `JavaScript`.

In `Perl`, it is not a numeric conversion operator.

Its primary technical aspect is `context disambiguation`.

<br>

### **Enforcing Scalar Context**

<br>

`Perl` has a fundamental concept of context: `scalar context` and `list context`.

The result of an operation can change dramatically depending on the context it's evaluated in.

The unary `+` is used to force an `expression` to be interpreted in `scalar context`.

This is most commonly needed when you have a function or an operator that expects a scalar argument but the argument you're providing is ambiguous and could be interpreted as a list.

This is the most frequent use case for unary `+` in modern `Perl` code.

<br>

```perl
my %hash = ( key => 'value' );
```

<br>

Now if we do this, then `{...}` is interpreted as an anonymous hash reference constructor and creates a key named `'HASH(0x...)'`.

<br>

```perl
$hash{shift} = 'new_value';
```

<br>

However, using unary `+` forces the contents of `{...}` to be evaluated in `scalar context`.

This tells `Perl` that `{...}` is a code block whose result is the key.

<br>

### **Why is this necessary?**

<br>

The `{ ... }` after a `$` sigil (`$hash{...}`) is ambiguous. It can be either:

<br>

```
a) A block returning an expression for the key (scalar context wanted).
b) An anonymous hash reference constructor e.g. $var = { a => 1 }.
```

<br>

The unary `+` resolves the ambiguity by signaling that what follows is an `expression`, not a `hash reference`.

<br>

### **What unary + is NOT in Perl?**

<br>

It is critical to understand that `Perl`'s unary `+` does not convert data types.

<br>

```
a) It does not convert a string to a number.
b) It does not have any mathematical effect on numbers.
```

<br>

```perl
my $string = "123abc";
my $number = +$string;     # This does NOT convert the string to 123!
print $number;             # Still prints "123abc"

my $num = 5;
my $result = +$num;        # $result is just 5. The + is a no-op here.
```

<br>

If you need to convert a string to a number, you would typically just use the string in a `numeric context` (like a mathematical operation) and `Perl` will do the conversion for you.

<br>

```perl
my $string = "123abc";
my $number = 0 + $string;  # Numeric context
print $number;             # Now prints "123"
```

<br>

### **Ambiguous blocks with map**

<br>

The `map` function takes either a block `{ ... }` or an `expression`.

The parser has to figure out which one you're using.

<br>

```perl
map { $_ * 2 } @array;     # the braces are a block for map
```

<br>

This is also clear - no braces, just an `expression`.

<br>

```perl
map $_ * 2, @array;        # no braces, just an expression
```

<br>

The ambiguity arises when you want to use a `complex expression` that includes `a dereference` or another `block`.

Is this `map` with a `block` or `map` with an `expression` containing a hashref?

Actually, this `WILL NOT COMPILE` as written.

<br>

```perl
map { $_->{name} } @array_of_hashrefs;
```

<br>

The parser sees `map { ... }` and thinks you're starting a `block` for the `map`.

But inside, you have `$_->{name} }` which includes a closing brace.

The parser gets confused about which brace closes the map block.

<br>

### **Unary + to the rescue**

<br>

Placing a unary `+` before the opening brace tells `Perl`: `"What follows is an expression not a map block."`

<br>

```perl
my @names = map +{ $_->{name} }, @array_of_hashrefs;
```

<br>

This is parsed as:

<br>

```
a) map( EXPRESSION, @array )
b) where EXPRESSION is +{ $_->{name} }
```

<br>

### **What's actually happening?**

<br>

```
a) Without +: map  { $_->{name} } ... is parsed as map(BLOCK, ...)
b) With +:    map +{ $_->{name} } ... is parsed as map(EXPRESSION, ...)
```

<br>

The `+` forces the `{ ... }` to be interpreted as an `anonymous hash reference constructor`, which is an `expression` rather than as the start of a `map block`.

<br>

### **More Examples**

<br>

Here this creates a list of hashrefs.

<br>

```perl
my @people = map +{ name => $_, age => 25 }, qw(Alice Bob Charlie);
```

<br>

Without `+` would be syntax error.

Like, in this complex expressions with blocks:

If you need a real block for complex logic but want to return a `hashref`.

<br>

```perl
my @data = map {
    my $value = complex_calculation($_);
    +{ result => $value, original => $_ }
} @input;
```

<br>

Well the unary `+` operator **IS NOT** the only way to resolve this ambiguity.

<br>

```perl
map +{ $_->{name} },        @array;     # Using unary +
map ({ $_->{name} }),       @array;     # Same using parenthesis
map do { $_->{name} },      @array;     # Same using do block
map sub { $_->{name} }->(), @array;     # Same using sub (overkill)
```

<br>

The `+` applies to what follows immediately, it's saying `"treat the next token as the start of an expression"`

It's purely syntactic at runtime, the `+` has no effect on the value.

<br>

```perl
my $href = +{ key => 'value' };  # Same as { key => 'value' }
```

<br>

This pattern appears with other functions that take `blocks` or `expressions`, like `grep`.

<br>

```perl
grep +{ $_->{active} }->{value}, @users;
```

<br>

If your expression doesn't contain `ambiguous braces` then you don't need the unary `+`.

These are fine without `+`.

<br>

```perl
map $_->{name}, @array_of_hashrefs;          # No braces at all
map $some_hash{$_}, @keys;                   # No ambiguous braces
map [ $_->{x}, $_->{y} ], @points;           # Square brackets are unambiguous
```

<br>

With `map`, unary `+` serves as a syntactic disambiguator that tells `Perl` to interpret `{ ... }` as a `hash reference` constructor (an expression) rather than as a `map` block.

It's a crucial tool for writing correct `Perl` code when you need to return `hash references` or other `brace-delimited` constructs from `map`.
