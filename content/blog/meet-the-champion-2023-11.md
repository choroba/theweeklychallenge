# Get to know about Peter Meszaros

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `Packy Anderson`, the winner of **[October 2023](/blog/meet-the-champion-2023-10)**.

Today we are talking to `Peter Meszaros`, the winner of **November 2023** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Peter:** I received my `MSc.E.E.` at [**BME**](https://www.bme.hu) `Budapest` in `1987` then I worked for `Hungarian power system`. A few years later I changed my job as `technology expert` for [**SCADA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) systems and slowly drifted towards programming. I wrote my first programs on `VAX/VMS` using `Fortran`.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl**?

**Peter:** My first encounter with `Perl` happened to be about `1998`. That time I worked for [**Budapest Stock Exchange**](https://bse.hu/) and I saw `GNU/Linux` very first time. As for `Perl`, it was love at first sight. I really enjoyed its funny syntax, the contexts and the inventive usage of our limited set of symbols from the keyboard. Next 15 years I wrote several small utilities in perl mostly for myself until `2013`, when I started coding in `Perl` for solving real problems at [**MSCI**](https://msci.com).

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** Probably I was searching for something `Perl`-related on the net and google showed me. Or I saw it on [**perlmonks**](http://perlmonks.org). I must admit I cannot recall.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:**  I don't use Perl at work these days at all and `"The Weekly Challenge"` keeps me entertained for the week!

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** Approximately I spend `two hours` with solving the challenges.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you check out others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Peter:** Sometimes yes. Especially if I am unsure of my understanding of the task. But always only after I pushed my solutions into the repository.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Peter:** Try it, it is fun to solve problems in `Perl`!

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Peter:** It would be nice to have more test cases for the tasks. Keep up and running `"The Weekly Challenge"`!
