## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #325` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes`, for sharing the [**blog post**](https://blog.ysth.info/idiomatic-perl-solutions-to-the-weekly-challenge-324) for the first time.

Thank you, `HVukman`, for sharing solution in [**J**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-324/hvukman/j/part1.ijs).

I noticed a big dip in guest contributions as compared to a week before i.e. from `Week 323: 60` to `Week 324: 38`.

I hope it would take a jump this week, fingers crossed.

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Consecutive One {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a binary array containing only `0` or/and `1`.

Write a script to find out the maximum consecutive `1` in the given array.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @binary = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
    Output: 3

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @binary = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    Output: 0

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @binary = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
    Output: 2

<br>

## Task 2: Final Price {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of item prices.

Write a script to find out the final price of each items in the given array.

There is a special discount scheme going on. If there's an item with a lower or equal price later in the list, you get a discount equal to that later price (the first one you find in order).

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @prices = (8, 4, 6, 2, 3)
    Output: (4, 2, 4, 2, 3)

    Item 0:
    The item price is 8.
    The first time that has price <= current item price is 4.
    Final price = 8 - 4 => 4

    Item 1:
    The item price is 4.
    The first time that has price <= current item price is 2.
    Final price = 4 - 2 => 2

    Item 2:
    The item price is 6.
    The first time that has price <= current item price is 2.
    Final price = 6 - 2 => 4

    Item 3:
    The item price is 2.
    No item has price <= current item price, no discount.
    Final price = 2

    Item 4:
    The item price is 3.
    Since it is the last item, so no discount.
    Final price = 3

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @prices = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @prices = (7, 1, 1, 5)
    Output: (6, 0, 1, 5)

    Item 0:
    The item price is 7.
    The first time that has price <= current item price is 1.
    Final price = 7 - 1 => 6

    Item 1:
    The item price is 1.
    The first time that has price <= current item price is 1.
    Final price = 1 - 1 => 0

    Item 2:
    The item price is 1.
    No item has price <= current item price, so no discount.
    Final price = 1

    Item 3:
    The item price is 5.
    Since it is the last item, so no discount.
    Final price = 5
