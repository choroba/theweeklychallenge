## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #264` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Andrew Shitov`, for reviewing `Raku` solutions for the [**Week #262**](/blog/p6-review-challenge-262). There was a time when we used to have weekly reviews of both `Perl` and `Raku` solutions. It was very popular among the `Team PWC` members. Unfortunately it is discontinued for sometime now. I am happy that `Andrew` found spare time last week for us and shared his views. I am not sure if this would be regular from now. I would be more than happy even if we get after break, it doesn't have to be every week.

Welcome back, `Robert DiCicco` after the break and thanks for sharing solution in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-263/robert-dicicco/perl/ch-1.pl).

Last week, `Asher Harvey-Smith`, introduced a new programming language `Hy` and shared his [**contribution**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-263/asherbhs/hy).

I would also like to thank, `Archar Gelod`, for taking up past challenges and sharing his creations in `Nim`. For all `Nim` fans, you must checkout his solutions. I am expecting it be part of `Top #10` guest languages soon.

Please keep sharing and spreading the word.

## Task 1: Greatest English Letter {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string, `$str`, made up of only alphabetic characters `[a..zA..Z]`.

Write a script to return the greatest english letter in the given string.

> A letter is greatest if it occurs as lower and upper case. Also letter 'b' is greater than 'a' if 'b' appears after 'a' in the English alphabet.

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = 'PeRlwEeKLy'
    Output: L

    There are two letters E and L that appears as lower and upper.
    The letter L appears after E, so the L is the greatest english letter.

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = 'ChaLlenge'
    Output: L

#### Example 3

    Input: $str = 'The'
    Output: ''

<br>

## Task 2: Target Array {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given two arrays of integers, `@source` and `@indices`. The `@indices` can only contains integers `0 <= i < size of @source`.

Write a script to create target array by insert at index `$indices[i]` the value `$source[i]`.

#### Example 1

    Input: @source  = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
           @indices = (0, 1, 2, 2, 1)
    Output: (0, 4, 1, 3, 2)

    @source  @indices  @target
    0        0         (0)
    1        1         (0, 1)
    2        2         (0, 1, 2)
    3        2         (0, 1, 3, 2)
    4        1         (0, 4, 1, 3, 2)

#### Example 2

    Input: @source  = (1, 2, 3, 4, 0)
           @indices = (0, 1, 2, 3, 0)
    Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

    @source  @indices  @target
    1        0         (1)
    2        1         (1, 2)
    3        2         (1, 2, 3)
    4        3         (1, 2, 3, 4)
    0        0         (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

#### Example 3

    Input: @source  = (1)
           @indices = (0)
    Output: (1)
