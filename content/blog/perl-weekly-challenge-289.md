Welcome to the `Week #289` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Let us all welcome one more `Perl` hacker, `Andre Ploger` to `Team PWC` and thanks for the first contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-288/aplgr/perl) and [**Go**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-288/aplgr/go). Even we had [**blog post**](https://dev.to/aplgr/diving-deep-recursive-solutions-for-palindromes-and-contiguous-blocks-1pah) too.

Thank you, `Conor Hoekstra`, for sharing solution in [**Python**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-288/conor-hoekstra/python/ch-1.py) for the first time.

`Paulo Custodio` is on mission to get all the past challenges in `Python`. Please keep it coming.

Thanks, `Dave Jacoby` for the [**blog post**](https://jacoby-lpwk.onrender.com/2024/09/26/return-of-the-son-of-this-looks-like-a-job-for-recursion-weekly-challenge-288.html) after a long gap.

`Hacktoberfest` annual festival is back once again. I am planning to join the `GitHub` repositories: [**The Weekly Challenge**](https://github.com/manwar/theweeklychallenge) and [**Perl Weekly Challenge Club**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club) like last year and allow all contributors to participate in the event..

`Good Luck` everyone and keep sharing.

## Task 1: Third Maximum {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the third distinct maximum in the given array. If third maximum doesn't exist then return the maximum number.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (5, 6, 4, 1)
    Output: 4

    The first distinct maximum is 6.
    The second distinct maximum is 5.
    The third distinct maximum is 4.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (4, 5)
    Output: 5

    In the given array, the third maximum doesn't exist therefore returns the maximum.

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints =  (1, 2, 2, 3)
    Output: 1

    The first distinct maximum is 3.
    The second distinct maximum is 2.
    The third distinct maximum is 1.

<br>

## Task 2: Jumbled Letters {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Ryan Thompson](https://ry.ca)
***

An Internet legend dating back to at least 2001 goes something like this:

> Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.

This supposed Cambridge research is unfortunately an urban legend. However, the effect *has* been studied. For example—and with a title that probably made the journal's editor a little nervous—*Raeding wrods with jubmled lettres: there is a cost* by Rayner, White, et. al. looked at reading speed and comprehension of jumbled text.

**Your task** is to write a program that takes English text as its input and outputs a jumbled version as follows:
1. The first and last letter of every word must stay the same
2. The remaining letters in the word are scrambled in a random order (if that happens to be the original order, that is OK).
3. Whitespace, punctuation, and capitalization must stay the same
4. The order of words does not change, only the letters inside the word

So, for example, "Perl" could become "Prel", or stay as "Perl," but it could *not* become "Pelr" or "lreP".

I don't know if this effect has been studied in other languages besides English, but please consider sharing your results if you try!
