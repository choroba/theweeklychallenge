## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #332` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

This is an early release the weekly challenge, as I mentioned last week about my planned short holiday trip with family.

I felt it was time to take a break as our last family trip was exactly two years ago, a three weeks visit to `India`.

This time, we're exploring a different part of the world, as the reason behind our previous trip to India trip no longer exists.

I lost both my parents 2 years ago.

Thank you all for the kind messages, they truly mean a lot to me.

Some late contributions to `Week #331` made it the best week of `2025` so far.

It's 2:00 AM on Saturday and  I'm releasing the next weekly challenge, two days early.

Any contributions from now on will be processed when I return on `July 30, 2025`.

`Happy Hacking!!`
