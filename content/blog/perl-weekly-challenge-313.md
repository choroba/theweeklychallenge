## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #313` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Thank you, `Kaushik`, for back to back contributions in [**Perl**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-312/kaushik-tunuguntla/perl) and [**blog post**](https://notmondayagain.blogspot.com/2025/03/discs-and-spheres.html).

I don't know if noticed this, there is a drop in `Raku` contributions.

We have some rock solid `Raku` supporters in the team. I am sure they can bring in more `Raku` hackers.

I am still waiting for the `100+` contributions week of the year `2025`. The closest we reached so far, was in the `Week #309` and the number was `90`.

`Guest` contributions have been on the rise all the time, never a dip in that front.

Keep the energy up and stay safe.

## Task 1: Broken Keys {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You have a broken keyboard which sometimes type a character more than once.

You are given a string and actual typed string.

Write a script to find out if the actual typed string is meant for the given string.

#### Example 1

    Input: $name = "perl", $typed = "perrrl"
    Output: true

    Here "r" is pressed 3 times instead of 1 time.

#### Example 2

    Input: $name = "raku", $typed = "rrakuuuu"
    Output: true

#### Example 3

    Input: $name = "python", $typed = "perl"
    Output: false

#### Example 4

    Input: $name = "coffeescript", $typed = "cofffeescccript"
    Output: true

<br>

## Task 2: Reverse Letters {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a string.

Write a script to reverse only the alphabetic characters in the string.

#### Example 1

    Input: $str = "p-er?l"
    Output: "l-re?p"

#### Example 2

    Input: $str = "wee-k!L-y"
    Output: "yLk-e!e-w"

#### Example 3

    Input: $str = "_c-!h_all-en!g_e"
    Output: "_e-!g_nel-la!h_c"
