## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #303` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Today is the first `Monday` of the month and year `2025`, so it is time to declare the last champion of the year `2024`. With great pride, I announce, `Arne Sommer` as the `Champion of the Month` for the second time. He has been one of the most consistent contributors for a very long time. I don't remember if he has ever missed a week. He primarily shared solutions in `Raku` but in the past he has also contributed in `Perl`. For me, the best contribution is his creative blog post every week. Plenty of discussion with link to the official documentation. Anyone can easily understand the underlying function. Thank you, `Arne Sommer`, for your support and contribution.

In couple of months i.e. `March 2025`, we would complete the `6th year` of weekly challenge. It has been a long journey. Without the support and encouragement, I wouldn't have made it so far. Having said, I do feel little tired now. Could it be, age is catching up? I still have plenty of support to carry on for few more years. I will never let it die, no matter what.

Keep sharing knowledge and fresh ideas in the new year.

## Task 1: 3-digits Even {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a list (3 or more) of positive integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return all even 3-digits integers that can be formed using the integers in the given list.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3, 0)
    Output: (102, 120, 130, 132, 210, 230, 302, 310, 312, 320)

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 2, 8, 8, 2)
    Output: (222, 228, 282, 288, 822, 828, 882)

<br>

## Task 2: Delete and Earn {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the following operation some number of times.

    Pick any ints[i] and delete it to earn ints[i] points.
    Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to ints[i] - 1
    and every element equal to ints[i] + 1.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (3, 4, 2)
    Output: 6

    Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently, 3 is also deleted.
    Finally delete 2 to earn 2 points.

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4)
    Output: 9

    Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted too.
    Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points.
    Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points.
