# Get to know about Ali Moradi

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we declared `Bruce Gray`, the winner of **November 2022**.

Today we are talking to `Ali Moradi`, the winner of **December 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Ali:** I first got interested in programming and programming languages by translating some `Python` articles to `Persian` for a website when I was in secondary school. After learning a bit of `Python`, I quickly started learning other languages mostly for fun and for being able to utilize their power.

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using **Perl/Raku**?

**Ali:** I'm a bookworm and am constantly looking for books on different subjects, and one day when I was looking on different websites, I saw the famous `Camel` book and read the Wikipedia page about `Perl` and found out that it's a great scripting language, then I started reading `Learning Perl`, `Intermediate Perl` and `Advanced Perl` before starting the `Camel` book and that's how I started learning `Perl` and honestly, it has been one of the best experiences of my life. About `Raku`, I just know the basics, and haven't studied it as much as `Perl`, and I have to say that although it's a very powerful language, it can sometimes be quite complex compared to `Perl`.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Ali:** I honestly don't quite remember, but I guess I came across it in the `Perl Programmers Facebook` group.

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Ali:** I like the diversity and level of complexity of the challenges and that you don't necessarily have to be a professional to solve them.

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Ali:** I don't have an exact answer for the amount of time spent on the tasks, but I guess about `1–2 hours a week` would be a good estimate.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Ali:** Yes, I sometimes check out the solutions by `W. Luis Mochán` (AKA wlmb), since they are very clever, to the point, and I learn a lot of `Perl` tricks from them :)

<br>

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Ali:** I would say that they can start with the easier tasks and build their skills from there, because there are a lot of amazing challenges to aid their learning, and also it would be beneficial if they try to do the challenges in as many languages as they can, because that would give them a broader perspective on the inner tricks and quirks of different languages.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Ali:** I would like to thank the `PWC` team for all their hard work and the amazing weekly challenges which make us become better programmers.

That brings the end of the conversation with **Ali Moradi**. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
