# Get to know about Kueppo Wesley.

Welcome to the monthly series `Meet The Champion`.

Last month we spoke to `Stephen G. Lynn`, the winner of **[August 2022](/blog/meet-the-champion-2022-08)**.

Today we are talking to `Kueppo Wesley`, the winner of **September 2022** of `The Weekly Challenge`. I hope you are going to enjoy the interview.

**Mohammad:** Tell us about your technical background?

**Kueppo:** Well, I started working with computers in `2018-2019`. That is my first year at University, before that I was more of a `Physician`, I did a lot of `Maths` and `Physics` in high school. Around `2020`, I started learning computer programming i.e a bit of `Alogrithms` and `C`. Closer to the end of the year I discovered `Linux`, that is where I started learning many interesting aspects of it, got into `System Administration and Networking`. Towards the end of `2021`, I started using `Perl` mainly as a sys admin tool. This year I'm trying to build a career as `Perl Developer`. So, yeah!! That is it :).

**Mohammad:** How/When did you start using Perl?

**Kueppo:** That was in `2021`, I was really curious about scripts in the `/bin` directory of my `Linux` distribution and so one day I got up and decided to check them all, I mean just viewing them without really understanding what they were doing :). Through my investigation, I saw a weird script looking a bit similar to `Bash`, that was `Perl`. I tried to get the idea of `Perl`, looking for its purpose and, after learning some of its features, I eventually fell in love with the language.

**Mohammad:** How did you come to know about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Kueppo:** I was searching for something about `Perl` in `DuckDuckGo`, and saw it. I was really excited about this, and I just gave it a try. Sooo.. BAMMM!! Here I am.

**Mohammad:** What do you like the most about `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Kueppo:** `"You don't have to be a genius"`, this is what I like the most :).

<br>

**Mohammad:** How much time you dedicate every week to `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Kueppo:** I can't give an approximation, I usually solve them every Saturday or Sunday nights, but if I get free time within the week then I attempt to solve at most one of the two tasks.

<br>

**Mohammad:** Do you checkout others solutions and who is your favorite?

**Kueppo:** The only person whose solutions I have ever checked out is `Julien Fiegehenn`, it is really comforting reading through the code and reminds me of the `Unix` philosophy of simplicity. We met via `Telegram` and he is helping me to get better at it every day.

**Mohammad:** What do you suggest someone just started `The Weekly Challenge`?

**Kueppo:** Ummmm.. don't know :), all of them, I think, are all Good.

**Mohammad:** Anything else you would to like to share with us?

**Kueppo:** Nothing special, apart from the fact that I love food and music :). Oh, did you know that I was born in `September`? Thank you for this PWC, which helps a lot in getting better at programming.

That brings the end of the conversation with `Kueppo Wesley`. Please do let us know your view. We will come back next month with another champion.
