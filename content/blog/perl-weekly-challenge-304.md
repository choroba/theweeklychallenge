Welcome to the `Week #304` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

`Year 2024` ends with yet another power packed contributions. Except year `2021`, every year we had more than `5K` contributions where we had full year. Even in the year `2021`, it was just `24` less than the magic number.

    Year 2022: 5375
    Year 2021: 4976
    Year 2020: 5187

The breakdown of overall contributions:

    Perl: 15801
    Raku: 8881
    Blog: 5584

With regard to the guest contributions, year `2024` was the best year so far where we had full year. Each year had more than `1K` contributions.

    Year 2024: 3265
    Year 2023: 2629
    Year 2022: 3002
    Year 2021: 2840

## Task 1: Arrange Binary {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given a list of binary digits (0 and 1) and a positive integer, `$n`.

Write a script to return true if you can re-arrange the list by replacing at least `$n` digits with `1` in the given list so that no two consecutive digits are `1` otherwise return false.

#### Example 1

    Input: @digits = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1), $n = 1
    Output: true

    Re-arranged list: (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)

#### Example 2

    Input: @digits = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1), $n = 2
    Output: false

<br>

## Task 2: Maximum Average {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers, `@ints` and an integer, `$n` which is less than or equal to total elements in the given array.

Write a script to find the contiguous subarray whose length is the given integer, `$n`, and has the maximum average. It should return the average.

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3), $n = 4
    Output: 12.75

    Subarray: (12, -5, -6, 50)
    Average: (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 12.75

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (5), $n = 1
    Output: 5
