## HEADLINES {#HEADLINES}
***

Welcome to the `Week #336` of `The Weekly Challenge`.

Welcome back, `Richard Park`, and thanks for your contributions in [**APL**](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/master/challenge-335/richard-park/apl).

Talking about guest contributors, below is the top five contributors:

<br>

#### 1: Roger Bell_West (3268)
#### 2: Abigail (1540)
#### 3: Ulrich Rieke (1148)
#### 4: Paulo Custodio (925)
#### 5: Ali Moradi (873)

<br>

The gap between `#1` and `#2` is too large, and `Abigail` is no longer active these days. This will only widen the gap.

`Paulo Custodio` is on a short break, so there's a good chance that `Ali Moradi` might soon take the `#4` rank.

Looking at the regular contributors, we have different set of contributors as listed below:

<br>

#### 1: Luca Ferrari (3350)
#### 2: Jaldhar H. Vyas (3060)
#### 3: Roger Bell_West (3060)
#### 4: Laurent Rosenfeld (2906)
#### 5: Arne Sommer (2308)

<br>

Here, except for `Laurent Rosenfeld`, everyone is active regularly, which makes this very interesting each week.

I also noticed the tie between `#2` and `#3`. Overall, among the top 5 contributors, the gap between them is not very big either.

<br>

`Happy Hacking!!`

## Task 1: Equal Group {#TASK1}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to return true if the given array can be divided into one or more groups: each group must be of the same size as the others, with at least two members, and with all members having the same value.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @ints = (1,1,2,2,2,2)
    Output: true

    Groups: (1,1), (2,2), (2,2)

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @ints = (1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3)
    Output: false

    Groups: (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3)

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @ints = (5,5,5,5,5,5,7,7,7,7,7,7)
    Output: true

    Groups: (5,5,5,5,5,5), (7,7,7,7,7,7)

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @ints = (1,2,3,4)
    Output: false

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @ints = (8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11)
    Output: true

    Groups: (8,8), (9,9), (10,10), (11,11)

<br>

## Task 2: Final Score {#TASK2}
##### **Submitted by:** [Mohammad Sajid Anwar](https://manwar.org)
***

You are given an array of scores by a team.

Write a script to find the total score of the given team. The score can be any integer, `+`, `C` or `D`. The `+` adds the sum of previous two scores. The score `C` invalidates the previous score. The score `D` will double the previous score.

<br>

#### Example 1

    Input: @scores = ("5","2","C","D","+")
    Output: 30

    Round 1: 5
    Round 2: 5 + 2
    Round 3: 5 (invalidate the previous score 2)
    Round 4: 5 + 10 (double the previous score 5)
    Round 5: 5 + 10 + 15 (sum of previous two scores)

    Total Scores: 30

<br>

#### Example 2

    Input: @scores = ("5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+")
    Output: 27

    Round 1: 5
    Round 2: 5 + (-2)
    Round 3: 5 + (-2) + 4
    Round 4: 5 + (-2) (invalidate the previous score 4)
    Round 5: 5 + (-2) + (-4) (double the previous score -2)
    Round 6: 5 + (-2) + (-4) + 9
    Round 7: 5 + (-2) + (-4) + 9 + 5 (sum of previous two scores)
    Round 8: 5 + (-2) + (-4) + 9 + 5 + 14 (sum of previous two scores)

    Total Scores: 27

<br>

#### Example 3

    Input: @scores = ("7","D","D","C","+","3")
    Output: 45

    Round 1: 7
    Round 2: 7 + 14 (double the previous score 7)
    Round 3: 7 + 14 + 28 (double the previous score 14)
    Round 4: 7 + 14 (invalidate the previous score 28)
    Round 5: 7 + 14 + 21 (sum of previous two scores)
    Round 6: 7 + 14 + 21 + 3

    Total Scores: 45

<br>

#### Example 4

    Input: @scores = ("-5","-10","+","D","C","+")
    Output: -55

    Round 1: (-5)
    Round 2: (-5) + (-10)
    Round 3: (-5) + (-10) + (-15) (sum of previous two scores)
    Round 4: (-5) + (-10) + (-15) + (-30) (double the previous score -15)
    Round 5: (-5) + (-10) + (-15) (invalidate the previous score -30)
    Round 6: (-5) + (-10) + (-15) + (-25) (sum of previous two scores)

    Total Scores: -55

<br>

#### Example 5

    Input: @scores = ("3","6","+","D","C","8","+","D","-2","C","+")
    Output: 128

    Round  1: 3
    Round  2: 3 + 6
    Round  3: 3 + 6 + 9 (sum of previous two scores)
    Round  4: 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 (double the previous score 9)
    Round  5: 3 + 6 + 9 (invalidate the previous score 18)
    Round  6: 3 + 6 + 9 + 8
    Round  7: 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 17 (sum of previous two scores)
    Round  8: 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 17 + 34 (double the previous score 17)
    Round  9: 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 17 + 34 + (-2)
