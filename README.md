This project is a fun and welcoming space for developers of all skill levels to explore Perl and Raku. We provide weekly challenges to encourage learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Whether you're an expert or a curious beginner, you'll find challenges to suit your skillset. We believe in fostering a supportive community where everyone can learn from each other. Feel free to ask questions, share your progress, and help fellow challengers on their coding journey.
